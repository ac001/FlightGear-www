<a 
  name="dx12-69001"></a>
<!--l. 127--><p class="noindent">Since we don&#8217;t have access to all possible flavors of Linux distributions, here are some
thoughts on possible causes of problems. (This Section includes contributions by Kai
Troester.)<a 
  name="dx12-69002"></a>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Wrong library versions
     <br class="newline">This is a rather common cause of grief especially when you prefer to install
                                                                     

                                                                     
     the libraries needed by <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>by hand. Be sure that especially the Mesa
     library contains support for the 3DFX<a 
  name="dx12-69003"></a> board and that GLIDE<a 
  name="dx12-69004"></a> libraries are
     installed  and  can  be  found.  If  a  <span 
class="pcrr7t---109">ldd `which fgfs` </span>complains about
     missing libraries you are in trouble.
     <!--l. 141--><p class="noindent">You should also be sure to <span 
class="ptmri7t---109">always keep the </span>latest version of <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">PLIB </span>on your
     system.  Lots  of  people  have  failed  miserably  to  compile  <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear  </span>just
     because of an outdated plib.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Missing permissions<a 
  name="dx12-69005"></a>
     <br class="newline">In case you are using XFree86<a 
  name="dx12-69006"></a> before release 4.0 the <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>binary may
     need to be setuid root in order to be capable of accessing some accelerator
     boards (or a special kernel module as described earlier in this document)
     based on 3DFX chips. So you can either issue a
     <!--l. 151--><p class="noindent"><span 
class="pcrr7t---109">chown root.root /usr/local/bin/fgfs ;</span>
     <br class="newline"><span 
class="pcrr7t---109">chmod 4755 /usr/local/bin/fgfs</span>
     <!--l. 154--><p class="noindent">to give the <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>binary the proper rights or install the 3DFX module.
     The latter is the &#8221;clean&#8221; solution and strongly recommended!
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Non-default install options
     <br class="newline"><span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>will display a lot of diagnostics while starting up. If it complains
     about  bad  looking  or  missing  files,  check  that  you  installed  them  in  the
     way  they  are  supposed  to  be  installed  (i.e.  with  the  latest  version  and  in
     the proper location). The canonical location <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>wants its data files
     under <span 
class="pcrr7t---109">/usr/local/lib</span>. Be sure to grab the latest versions of everything
     that might be needed!
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Compile problems in general
     <br class="newline">Make sure you have the latest (official) version of gcc. Old versions of gcc
     are a frequent source of trouble! On the other hand, some versions of the
     RedHat 7.0 reportedly have certain problems compiling <span

     include a preliminary version of GCC.

     <!--l. 178--><p class="noindent">the reason is a missing library package called Metakit. This is provided with
