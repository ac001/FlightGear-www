<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >Did you ever want to fly a plane yourself, but lacked the money or ability to
do so? Are you a real pilot looking to improve your skills without having to
take off? Do you want to try some dangerous maneuvers without risking your
life? Or do you just want to have fun with a more serious game without any
violence? If any of these questions apply to you, PC flight simulators are just for
you.
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   You may already have some experience using Microsoft<a 
 id="dx5-8001"></a>&#8217;s <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">© </span>Flight Simulator or any
other of the commercially available PC flight simulators. As the price tag of those is
usually within the $50 range, buying one of them should not be a serious problem given
that running any serious PC flight simulator requires PC hardware within the $1500
range, despite dropping prices.
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   With so many commercially available flight simulators, why would we spend
thousands of hours of programming and design work to build a free flight simulator?
Well, there are many reasons, but here are the major ones:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">All of the commercial simulators have a serious drawback: they are made
     by a small group of developers defining their properties according to what
     is important to them and providing limited interfaces to end users. Anyone
     who  has  ever  tried  to  contact  a  commercial  developer  would  agree  that
     getting your voice heard in that environment is a major challenge. In contrast,
     <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>is designed by the people and for the people with everything out
     in the open.
     </li>
                                                                     

                                                                     
     <li class="itemize">Commercial simulators are usually a compromise of features and usability.
     Most commercial developers want to be able to serve a broad segment of
     the population, including serious pilots, beginners, and even casual gamers.
     In reality the result is always a compromise due to deadlines and funding.
     As <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>is free and open, there is no need for such a compromise.
     We have no publisher breathing down our necks, and we&#8217;re all volunteers
     that make our own deadlines. We are also at liberty to support markets that
     no commercial developer would consider viable, like the scientific research
     community.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Due to their closed-source nature, commercial simulators keep developers
     with  excellent  ideas  and  skills  from  contributing  to  the  products.  With
     <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear</span>, developers of all skill levels and ideas have the potential to make
     a huge impact on the project. Contributing to a project as large and complex
     as <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>is very rewarding and provides the developers with a great
     deal of pride in knowing that we are shaping the future of a great simulator.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Beyond everything else, it&#8217;s just plain fun! I suppose you could compare us
     to real pilots that build kit-planes or scratch-builts. Sure, we can go out a
     buy a pre-built aircraft, but there&#8217;s just something special about building one
     yourself.</li></ul>
<!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >   The points mentioned above form the basis of why we created <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear</span>. With
those motivations in mind, we have set out to create a high-quality flight simulator that
aims to be a civilian,<a 
 id="dx5-8002"></a> multi-platform,<a 
 id="dx5-8003"></a> open,<a 
 id="dx5-8004"></a> user-supported,<a 
 id="dx5-8005"></a> and user-extensible<a 
 id="dx5-8006"></a> platform.
Let us take a closer look at each of these characteristics:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Civilian:</span><a 
 id="dx5-8007"></a>  The  project  is  primarily  aimed  at  civilian  flight  simulation.  It
     should  be  appropriate  for  simulating  general  aviation  as  well  as  civilian
     aircraft. Our long-term goal is to have <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>FAA-approved as a flight
     training  device.  To  the  disappointment  of  some  users,  it  is  currently  not
     a  combat  simulator;  however,  these  features  are  not  explicitly  excluded.
     We just have not had a developer that was seriously interested in systems
     necessary for combat simulation.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Multi-platform:</span><a 
 id="dx5-8008"></a> The developers are attempting to keep the code as
     platform-independent as possible. This is based on their observation that people
     interested in flight simulations run quite a variety of computer hardware and
     operating systems. The present code supports the following Operating
     Systems<a

<!--l. 170--><p class="noindent" >In comparison to other recent flight simulators, the system requirements<a 
 id="dx5-9002"></a> for <span

you have a proper 3D graphics card<a 
 id="dx5-9003"></a>.
<!--l. 176--><p class="indent" >   One important prerequisite for running <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>is a graphics card whose driver
supports OpenGL<a 
 id="dx5-9004"></a>. If you don&#8217;t know what OpenGL<a

widely used and supported 2-D and 3D graphics application programming interface
(API)...&#8221;.
<!--l. 188--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>does not run (and will never run) on a graphics board which only
supports Direct3D<a 
 id="dx5-9006"></a>/DirectX<a 
 id="dx5-9007"></a>. Contrary to OpenGL, Direct3D is a proprietary interface,
being restricted to the Windows operating system.
<!--l. 192--><p class="indent" >   You may be able to run <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>on a computer that features a 3D video card
not supporting hardware accelerated OpenGL<a 
 id="dx5-9008"></a> &#8211; and even on systems without
3D graphics hardware at all. However, the absence of hardware accelerated
OpenGL support can bring even the fastest machine to its knees. The typical
signal for missing hardware acceleration are frame rate<a 
 id="dx5-9009"></a>s below 1 frame per
second.
<!--l. 197--><p class="indent" >   Any modern 3D graphics featuring OpenGL<a 
 id="dx5-9010"></a> support will do. For Windows<a 
 id="dx5-9011"></a> video
card drivers that support OpenGL, visit the home page of your video card manufacturer.
You should note that sometimes OpenGL drivers<a 
 id="dx5-9012"></a> are provided by the manufacturers of
the graphics chip instead of by the makers of the board. If you are going to buy a
graphics card for running <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear</span>, an NVIDIA GeForce card is recommended, as
these tend to have better OpenGL support than AMD/ATI Radeon. 256MB of dedicated
graphics memory will be more than adequate - many people run <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>happily on
less.
<!--l. 206--><p class="indent" >   To install the executable and basic scenery, you will need around 500 MB of free disk
space<a 
 id="dx5-9013"></a>. In case you want/have to compile the program yourself you will need about
another 500 MB for the source code and for temporary files created during compilation.
This does not include the development environment, which will vary in size depending
on the operating system and environment being used. Windows users can expect to need
approximately 300 MB of additional disk space for the development environment.
Linux and other UNIX machines should have most of the development tools
already installed, so there is likely to be little additional space needed on those
platforms.
<!--l. 216--><p class="indent" >   For the sound effects<a

<!--l. 257--><p class="noindent" >Historically, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>was based on a flight model it inherited (together with the

result, <span

     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Possibly the most important one is the JSB flight model developed by Jon

     <li class="itemize">Christian Mayer developed a flight model of a hot air balloon. Curt Olson

     aerodynamics,  which  result  in  more  realism  in  extreme  attitudes,  such  as

(but fortunately not all) of the information herein can also be obtained from the
