ARCHIVE SERIAL: #001-020796
ANNOUNCEMENT DATED: 02.July 1996 19:24EDT [FGADM.01-DM]

ATTN all Flight Gear FS developers and list participants

This is to officially welcome you to the Flight Gear Development family.
Anytime you see this letterhead, you will know that official business
is being announced. In any case, I would like to take this time to ask
your cooperation in our first big steps into getting this simulator
off the ground. (Pardon the pun) :)

I've noticed that list activity has slowed to almost nothing in the
past month or so, so I thought I'd send this out to try to get us
back on track. Up until now, we've mostly just been unorganized,
sending in code and miscellaneous announcements and examples. This
approach is fine initially, but I feel we're in need of more organization
to manage time, coordinate group communication, and the writing of
actual code. 

Below, I've appended a "skeleton" list of groups that need to be created:

* Administration
	Keeps everyone on task and is the "central power" that
	all groups report to.
* Archives Department
	Stores all announcements and code (basically everything)
	that is related to the FGFS project.
* Programming (specific subdivisions included)
	- Kernel module: writes and hashes out issues concerning the
	  core of the simulator and maintains updates of the kernel
	  (similar to the Linux project) once the simulator is publicly
	  released.
		SUGGESTED GROUP PARTICIPANTS:
			* Curt Olson
			* Maurizio Gavioli
			* Eric Korpela
	- Visuals/graphics: writes routines that relate to the visual
	  display of objects in the simulator.
		SUGGESTED GROUP PARTICIPANTS:
			* ???
	- User interface: handles issues concerning the graphical
	  user interface of the simulator.
	- Wx generation: writes code and resolves issues concerning the
	  retrieval of real-time weather and the display of the wx.
	  Will coordinate heavily with the visuals team.
		SUGGESTED GROUPS PARTICIPANTS:
			* Curt Olson
			* ?
	- ATC development: talking, interactive, SMART air traffic control.

	- Scenery: hashes out issues dealing with the display of scenery,
	  in the respect of file structure and level of detail, etc.
		SUGGESTED GROUP PARTICIPANTS:
			* Maurizio Gavioli
			* ?
	
	- Aircraft Visual Modeling: Will basically be a subdivision of
	  the scenery and visuals team. Determines how an aircraft will
	  be represented (in terms of file structure, texture display,
	  etc.)
	- Motion/flight modeling: Will create and or implement equations
	  /code to accurately model flight on the computer.
		** This team must keep in mind that 100% realism is NOT
		   THE most important factor. We must also consider frame
		   rate, and find a happy medium between calculation and
		   graphic display/refresh rates.

These are all of the groups that I can think of at the moment, but
you are certainly free to add to these in any way you see fit.
Now that we know WHAT we need to do, we now need to decide WHO is
going to be in these groups. As you can see, I have listed certain
people as "suggested" on the basis of what they have done for
Microsoft Flight Simulator. They and anyone else is/are certainly welcome
to be on any team they wish. I have "appointed" myself to be a part
of the administration team, since my programming ability (especially in
C) is not advanced enough to be of any help in this project. 

Shmuel Ben-Artiz (I apologize for spelling errors that I may have made
in any of y'alls names :) has suggested that we have a liason in 
every team that will communicate with other teams that the administration.
The admins will periodically post an annoucement to this list stating
what each team is working on and where to download their work to take
a look at it. 

I think that, when we are finally ready for our first public release,
we should have a pre-compiled version of everything for those that
have no interest in tinkering with the code. Or, if the person
is in an adventurous state of mind :) they can download all the code.

Another point is, are we going to have different distributions of this
simulator? (Again, like the Linux project) Obviously, people are going
to be publishing custom modules, and perhaps a radically different 
simulator in the end. Will we official update a standard kernel every
so often, or will this be up to each distribution's management? 

In any case, this simulator MUST REMAIN FREE OF CHARGE forever! That
is the original goal of this program in the first place. I believe we
are going by the GNU license? 

Our next problem is: in what language do we write this? I strongly 
suggest C, as this is the native language of the bulk of our programmers.
I think we have decided on DJGPP for the DOS and Linux versions?
What compiler will we use for Windows95? Let's say right off, that we're
going to avoid Visual Basic completely. VB is simply too slow for the 
kind of work that this simulator is going to require. 
Microsoft Visual C++ perhaps?

My opinion is: we should work on the DOS version first, then on to
Windows95, and then port it to Linux and whatever other operating
systems we see fit. DOS is what MOST people in "our target market"
 are using right now, even though the architecture is a little old. 
Win95 seems to be the "wave of the future" <groan>, so I suppose that 
will be next.

In addition to all this, I'd like to bring up another issue...
where do we get the data for realistic terrain/geography plotting?

Let me know, and let's come up with the other issues that need to
be confronted! I'm looking forward to responses... let's go ahead
and decide what groups we're going to be in! :)

Regards,
David Murr

PS: I'll explain the archives codes and all that in a little bit... :)

This is probably where I would fit in best. I am a real world pilot,
currently flying KC-135R's in the USAF. I also have experience flying
smaller jets, twin-turboprops, and c-172/152. Although I have an Elec
Engineering degree, my C is a little rusty, so I probably could only write
pseudocode and leave the hard programming to others.  Let me know. 

Yes, frame rate is a very important part of the flight model since visual
cues will be the only "feel" our sim will have, unless we can incorporate
force-feedback at a later time.

Yes, good idea.

Maybe USGS data?

Well, Curt, since I am just starting to learn C, I don't think that
programming is for me.  I do do a lot of administrative work at my school for
our technology office, and on the e-mail system,  so if you need any more
people for that, that is one of my strong suits,  I like to be very organized!
 I also work on Macs, so when (if we ever) work on a version for Mac I can do
that,  please mail me back with what you had in mind 

Thanx

        Well folks...I don't have ANY knowledge of programming,but I'm aldo
a real world pilot,currently flying a Piper Seneca II Twin here in Brazil. I
would like a lot to help to develop a flight model as realistic as possible!

Since this is a holiday weekend for those of us in the States,
I'm in not big rush, but if you'd like to sign up for a
particular team, please send me (dmurr@pen.k12.va.us) your
name, e-mail address, and what group you'd like to participate
in. We'll sort it all out, and announce who's in what later.

We already have 2 ppl. that have expressed interest in the
flight modeling aspect... I'm in admin. Anyone??

If you don't sign up for a slot, you may not get what you
wanted to do initially! :)

Thanks, /dlm

Dave,

Please sign me up for the admin group. 

My experience in this field basically consists of breaking projects down
into their component parts and tracking them, coordinating the activities of
various groups working on a single project (small to medium sized), and
leading small groups. I also have one additional quality which you may use
or not as you see fit: I play a superb devil's advocate (perhaps you've
already noticed that). 

I am not a programmer, though I do understand the principles of hierarchical
and object-oriented programming, including the basics of C and C++. I have
used internal programming systems (e.g. dBASE IV) to create database and
other systems, and have had considerable experience designing and using
spreadsheets. I work extensively with word processors and *simple* DTP
(Mircosoft Publisher). 

I have studied HTML and web site development and have prepared a small web
site for the school that I work for: a Hebrew language academy called Ulpan
Akiva. This will eventually grow to about 60-80 pages. If you'd like to take
a look at it, its hosted at WorldWide Classroom. The URL is
www.worldwide.edu and then follow the links to Countries:Israel. I intend to
build up a freelance business relating to the Internet.

I am the Data Services Manager for Ulpan Akiva, and am the Administrator of
our Novell 3.12 LAN. I am presently studying those aspects of the Internet
related to Educational Technology and the development of online teaching
programs. I am also the co-director of the Netanya, Israel PC Users Group.

I have had experience in technical writing (and several other forms of
written and verbal communications), including one job as an engineering tech
writer. I have participated in a few beta test projects, and usually
concentrate on the quality and readability of the printed docs, tutorials, etc.

Belated wishes for the 4th and Shalom,

Shmuel

OK, so far...

We have 2 for flight modeling and testing
... and 4 (including me) for administration. I don't think
there should be more than 10 ppl. in admin. -- it would just
get too hectic.

All of our programmers are busy writing code, I guess... ;^)

Hi Team,

After giving myself some time to think about it, I've decided to 
unsub.  Been thinking about my last (2nd) post, which was actually my 
1st bit of input.  There was a reply to the list immediately 
following mine, however the tone seemed to be saying, we already know 
that technology and to prove it I'm going to blub out stuff you'll 
never understand (and right he was <s>.)  This not only pointed out 
to me that there's really nothing I can do here, but that I wouldn't 
care to anyway, with within such closed off and isolated 
conversations between yourselves <s>.

For the good of the project, I hope that 'programmer elite" attitude 
will disappear.  I now question your motives for doing this project.  
Perhaps it would be wise to ask yourselves, "am I doing this out of 
pride and recognition, or is it really for the good of many?"  With 
no hard fellings (maybe a little miffed <g>.), I wish you all well.

I think I will unsub too, but for a different reason:  I think this
project is drifting way off course.

I presume the whole reason for getting FS enthusiasts together to
write a freeware flight simulator is to make the BEST simulator money
can't buy, not just a MFS clone.  But the MFS clone is where this
project seems to be headed; you all are aiming way too low!

In the area of scenery, for example, I keep seeing messages saying
things like "it would be nice to do realistic full-polygon-shaded
super 3D texturing bla-de-bla, but we can't because it won't run with
acceptable frame rates on a 486."  Well then, BLOW OFF the 486!!!  Why
does Flight Gear have to run on your grandmother's four-year-old
machine?  I want to see a flight simulator with a realistic flight
model and realistic scenery, with lots of buildings, telephone poles,
bridges, trees, moving cars on the streets, etc. -- not just a few
textured cubes and triangles plunked down on a flat painted landscape.
I think many others want that too.

This project probably has a year at least before it produces even the
beginnings of an actual running simulator.  By then, $1500 computers
at K-Mart will be 200 MHz Pentiums with MMX extensions (or Macs with
150 MHz PowerPC 604 chips).  I think that nothing less than a 90 MHz
Pentium, running a real multithreaded OS like Windows 95 or NT or OS/2
or Linux, should be the target for Flight Gear -- it's not supposed to
be an FS clone, but the best flight simulator for serious enthusiasts!
Don't let ridiculously low platform requirements cripple it.

Nooooo, noooo, nooo! I think we've miscommunicated somewhere! :(
The programming part is only a slice out of the pie of what
needs to be done! We posted warnings that the list topics were
often highly technical, as that is almost a requirement for
this project. But, our first objective, as I pointed out in the
memo, is to get everyone into teams that would like to take an
ever-present active role in the development of the simulator. 

Without specific teams, it would be incredibly difficult to get
anything done. Or am I wrong here? Should we just be spread out,
with sproadic communication between programmers? It would seem
that this would only bring on confusion and a poorly written
simulator. Have I missed something? I really don't understand
why you're talking about, Kevin. :(

Again, I don't really understand... who presents this
"programmer elite" attitude? I'm pretty sure it's not me, as I
know very little programming! :) 

And I'm not going to lie and say this is 100% "for the
people"... hell, that's against human nature... but yes, mostly
we're doing this because (hopefully) we know what the want in a
sim, and we can provide it for ourselves. Hopefully. Obviously,
I cannot comment on individual motives for joining the project,
mine are that I want a flight sim that fufills my "wanted"
features in a sim... and obviously, the big companies aren't
doing that so... here we are...

So, Kevin, and everyone -- please tell me if it's something I'm
doing that's given you this perspective, because I'd like to
change it right now. Since you may have already unsubscribed,
I'll forward youa copy to your e-mail address.. hopefully
you'll stay with us, but if not, well... that's certainly your
perogative. :(

David Murr

David,

I've been just listening in since I introducing myself a couple of
months ago.  It looks like all have the best of intentions.  As you
know, finding talent is not the difficult part.  Bringing everyone
together and getting them all pointed in the same direction is
Flight-Gear's greatest challenge (as will all worthwhile
undertakings).  Flight-Gear needs to determine through collaboration
and consensus, with great detail, what it is Flight-Gear intends to
create and when it intends to have it completed.  From here, all
constructive turmoil and strife will arise.  Objectives with
deadlines.  (suddenly everyone screams...furiously typing hate mail to
this "Ed" character).

Best regards with a grin,

Ed

It's a shame to see people leave, but we are at a point right now
where not to many people can contribute.  We need to get a basic sim
with an open architecture up and running before lots of people will
jump on the band wagan.  Flight-Gear is a great idea, but we haven't
moved too far forward yet.

For any who are considering leaving this list, I wish you the best in
all your future endevours.  Please check in on us once in a while.

This is, and will always be the goal.  However, we cannot achieve this
instantly.  We must build up to it incrementally.  I think MSFS
compatibility is a worthy first step.  It would give us access to a
huge amount of scenery.  There's no reason why we can't support .bgl
format while also developing a much better format.

Unfortunately, a lot of us still have 486's.  I was thinking of
upgrading to a Cyrix 5x86 120 this month, but it doesn't look like its
going to happen this summer.

Like I said before, this is a great target to shoot towards.  However,
we are all doing this in our spare time as a hobby.  We need to bite
off chunks we can chew.  Once we get going though, with enough people
chewing, we just might get there.

Now's a great time to buy a computer, hopefully in a year it will be
even better.  However, someone with a 486 isn't going to be too
excited about writing software they can't run.  I think if we can
write a simulator that runs acceptably on a 486, we will be much
better off when running on higher end machines.  We will have much
more room to add even cooler features (every byte of code slows things
down just a bit.)

We will all have different goals and ideas about what FlightGear
should be.  My "vision" is for FlightGear to be a common framework
upon which we can all pursue our own directions, goals, and ideas,
while at the same time cooperating so our work benifits everyone.

Curt.

Okay... let me put my opinion into the pot. This is the second
time I've seen a message of someone who intends to unsubscribe
for whatever reason. This is a cooperative project, is it not?
So why put in your $0.02 and then unsubscribe? If that happens,
we all lose - you (you is a generic term here) won't get to
continue giving your input, which is the core of this project
(i.e., what the users want) and the project will suffer greatly
if everyone
starts unsubing because things aren't going the way they'd
like. Now, I'm not trying to flame anyone, but -- we haven't
gone ANYWHERE yet in terms of WHAT we're going to do! If we go
Pentium only, fine... we haven't decided yet... that's why we
need everyone's input... the drafts that I've been putting
together are just suggestions, as I've said. They're certainly
not written in stone. All I wanted to do last night was to try
to get the ball rolling again by putting us into logical groups
so that we could get together and brainstorm and express our
opinions -- without this kind of organization, the project is
going to flop before we can ever do anything.

<ROFL> :) You make excellent points, and that's what we need to
continue doing, but please don't unsubscribe. The thread you
mention is over a month old, and everything's been rather
static since then, and we need to keep going with it...
determine how and why and when this thing will run... right?

So, am I completely insane and really missing something big
here or what? Someone please comment.

Rob,

If that's what you honestly believe, then stick around and fight for it. I,
for one, value your input. 

BTW, remember Spectrum HoloByte's approach in Falcon 3, where they created a
*true* high fidelity model of the F-16 cockpit for those machines capable of
running it, with a reduced fidelity model for less-capable machines? Why not
adopt the same approach? We're seeing the same kind of thing on all over the
Web today with sites being mirrored for forms-capable/not capable or
frames-capable/not capable browsers.

Hang in there.

Well, I typed a big long eloquent reply to this, it took me nearly an
hour, then just before I clicked on the "send" button, Netscape
crashed and blew it all away.  So here's the short, humorless version
(sent from Agent this time!):

I think the main message I am trying to get across is that time needs
to be taken to make sure that the world model and 3D engine have no
arbitrary limits to the number, complexity and density of the polygons
and textures.  None of this "gee there's no way any computer is going
to handle an airplane made out of 10000 textured polygons, so let's
make our data structure simple by limiting each 3D object to 16
polygons" crap.  Maybe your 486/50 can't handle it, but in two years,
your Octium MegaPro/300 will fly through that much detail at 60 frames
per second and beg for more.  The key word here is SCALEABILITY.
Flight Simulator has blocky, jagged, sparse terrain regardless of
whether you run it on a 486/33 or Pentium/200, because it does not
have that degree of scaleability -- the data is built the lowest
common denominator platform.  Don't make the same mistake with FG!

Curt,

>where not to many people can contribute.  

That *may* be true within the tight confines of developing flight models. I
wouldn't presume to wade into the morass of mathematical calculations, 3
DOF/6 DOF trade-offs, reality vs. plausibility compromises, etc. in that area.

But that's not the whole picture. The flight model will not exist as an
island apart. It will have to be part of a total approach that will involve
scenery design, interactive ATC interfaces, cross-platform considerations,
programming objects to make possible the design of all forms of
instrumentation and flight control needed for realistic flight control,
advanced panel designs. The list goes on.

The basic architecture will have to include as much as possible of the
"goodies" which will make up a fully integrated system before it will
develop much enthusiasm. If we want to entice more causal simmers into
becoming serious sim enthusiasts (and this is a requirement if our project
is to become more than just the "toy of the elite few") then everything must
fit together from the beginning into a seamless, user-friendly (don't you
just hate that term) environment.

Please keep in mind that FS-compatible and FS clone are not necessarily the
same thing. I think that you and Robert are really arguing two sides of the
same coin here. We don't need to create a MS-lookalike in order for it to be
operationally compatible with FS.

When will FG be ready to beta, let alone to "market" (yes, I know that it'll
be freeware). Next week? Next month? *Maybe* next year. And the decisions
regarding platforms and technologies have to be made with those
considerations in mind. If you only have a 486 available and you want to
test out some advanced graphics concepts that are only practical on high-end
machines, then I'm sure that someone on the list will find a way to make the
services of one available to you for that purpose (just as long as you don't
need a Cray 2B).

But that's one of the reasons that we will also need as part of our team one
or two people who are adept at reading cybermarket trends and can produce
reliable "guesstimates" (how's that for an oxymoron) about what hardware and
software technologies will be *broadly available* and *commonly in use* by
the projected release time.

And that's one of the reasons for attracting as broad a talent base as
possible from the beginning. There's no reason that part of the team can't
already be looking at how Phase I can easily transition into Phase II right
from the start.

Very true, Curt. And I would think that one of the responsibilities of the
admin group would be to keep the broad picture in view so that each
individual in each specialized group doesn't have to constantly relate their
own work to other fields that they possibly don't have a great deal of
expertise in. Thus the work of the programmers can be melded with the work
of the aeornautical theoreticains, the designers of broad sceneries, the
specialists in major airports, the panel designers, the creators of
adventures, and so on. 

Perhaps it will develop that there will be a number of lists like this, each
devoted to specialized aspects of the overall package. Perhaps the process
will develop along the lines of a whole new paradigm in small group/large
group team efforts. Whatever, the end result must be to make it possible to
maximize the efforts of each individual "technician" by allowing them to
apply themself fully to their own area of expertise.

Basically, what I'm saying in this response is that everything that you've
said is valid and makes perfect sense in the restricted context in which you
said it. But I'm also arguing for a look at the broader picture.

Shalom,

Shmuel

Suggested additional subdivisions of programming group:

- Aircraft Systems Modelling.
- Testing.

Aircraft Systems Modelling

As discussed in many other postings, we must start simple before adding
complexity. But I think we ought to make a point of looking at the
things which cause real world problems, and looking at accident /
incident statistics for light aircraft, systems problems (usually pilot
induced) are often a factor. This doesn't seem to be covered by the
descriptions of the groups so far, it seems to me to be a different
issue than 'flight modelling'.


Testing

There are a few real world pilots like myself following this list. I
don't know about the others, but speaking for myself whilst I have a
good understanding of the basic principles of software design and have
done a bit of coding over the years, I am not experienced in any
'powerful' language and definitely not up to coding any of these things.
So it seems that the best thing to do with me (and perhaps some of the
others) is to act as testers, as well as acting as general consultants
for 'what really happens' questions.



You could put me down for either of these roles as well as consulting on
the ATC module.

Also OK, if not conflicting with the previous.

Recently, I have been a bit lazy (well, I had to pay attention to other
things...) and I'm not sure I will be more productive in the near future.
So, it would be better to have other persons in the same department(s)...

Sorry it took me so long to respond to this.  I apparently get to
spend most of my summer with bronchitis.  The groups idea is great.
Sign me up for the Administration, Kernel, and Visuals/graphics
group.  (It's pretty much what I've been doing anyway.)

For windows 95 we could use the Win-32 version of GCC, but I think that's
up to the windows programmers to standardize on.  (I think it's available
from the Cygnus ftp site.) For OS/2, I think that EMX is the way to go.

Agreed, but I think that concurrent development is possible, in that
all routines should be as platform independent as possible.  All of my code
to date will run on DJGPP, EMX, Sunos, and Linux/ELF.  I intend to keep
everything I write that way.  (I still haven't gotten the entire demo package 
together, but I'm working on it slowly but surely.  Any volunteers wishing
to help, raise your hands. Especially Mac/Windows programmers)  For DOS, I'm 
only up to 320x200 graphics, but I hope to expand that to 640x480 soon.

I looked at jlib, and there are some good ideas there that I may coopt into
the demo package, but as a whole the library has a few snags.  I'm also
not sure it's license is compatible with the GPL, so I may have to reverse
engineer the good parts.

Eric, 

Your point about cross-platforming is well taken. It will be well to keep in
mind that Win95 may be the LAST Windows product that includes a DOS shell.
If the "basic" platform is created for DOS, it may wind up being obsolete
before it is released, as MS already has little reason to support the future
development of DOS.

Shalom,

Shmuel

I suspect that DOS will be around for quite a while longer, in the
form of a "virtual DOS window" (like the one in Windows NT), or even
an emulator program.  You sure won't want to run a flight simulator in
it, though!

To all developers,

It was announced yesterday that MS is planning to turn ActiveX over to an
impartial standards group made up of apps developers, hardware manufacturers
and others. This will allow them to take the high road and get the jump on
Netscape re: cross-platform and open architecture operability.

If this policy is fully implemented, it could make it easier for our
designers to make full use of ActiveX and OLE standards in designing
add-ons. For those who would like to pursue this in greater depth, C|CNET=FD
(www.cnet.com) has a more in depth analysis of this story on their Front
Page under the title "ZctiveX could be becoming Brand X".

Hi guys,

This is just a quick note to let you know that I have moved the
flightgear web page to a new server.  The *new* URL is:

    http://www2.me.umn.edu/~clolson/fgfs

Note, the old web page still exists and points you to the new web
page.

Thanks,

Curt.

Hi guys,

Lately I've been playing around with ACM on my Linux box.  ACM stands
for Air Combat Maneuvers.  It is a free (src included) flight sim for
Unix/X.  If any of you are interested in looking at this, check out:

    ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/ra/rainey/acm/index.html

After playing around with this sim for a while, I have concluded that
it represents a significant amount of work, and is a very worth-while
program.

I have a little proposal for you all to consider.  I propose that we
base our Flight Gear project off of this product.  I have put some ACM
screen shots up on the new flight gear web page:

    http://www2.me.umn.edu/~clolson/fgfs


Some of the current features of ACM are:

  - Freeware -- all source code included.
  - Pretty good flight model that can be tailored to different kinds
    of aircraft / missles / flying things.
  - Sound support (with some pretty descent sound effects).
  - Allows definition of new planes.
  - U.S. Navy Postgraduate School's Distributed Interactive
    Simulation (IEEE DIS, RFC <something or other>) code integrated
    into it.  This allows multiple ACM servers to talk to each other
    over local subnets.  You can go 2 vs. 2 over a network.
    This also allows you to integrate with other simulation packages that
    use this same standard.  (i.e. a tank simulation, or ATC simulation or
    whatever.)
  - Some serial-port joystick support
  - Currently has a nice rendition of the Hawaiian Islands based on DEM data.
  - Has distance visibility effects (haze).
  - Models springiness of landing gear.
  - Has a very nice HUD display.
  - Has an HSI on the instrument panel.


Features in the upcoming version (due out real soon now):

  - True spheroidal world.
  - Scene descriptions in latitude/longitude/MSL-height coordinates.
  - Automated extracts of scene descriptions from the FAA databases.
  - Support for a non-zero feet MSL surface height.
  - NAVAID support for the features listed above.


Weaknesses:

  - Terrain modeling has room for improvement in the area of hidden surface
    removal and shading.
  - Usability -- no menus and such.
  - Scenery object descriptors are pretty primitive.
  - Code is not structured well for modularity.
  - Currently only supports Unix/X11
  - Saying the representation of the instrument panel is crude would
    be heaping undeserved praise upon said instrument panel.  Although it
    does have an HSI which FS5/6/7/... still lacks.
  - Scenery is pretty scarce.
  - Although it does have a single overcast cloud layer, this is the
    totallity of it's weather modeling.
  - Currently only support X11 for graphics.


Comments:

Civilian vs. Military:

ACM is currently focused towards military combat, but it does come
with a Cesna 172 airplane.  Slap on a censa inst. panel, and add some
scenery and we would already be pretty close to FS4 functionality.
Although it would be a bummer to have an F-18 swoop down and knock you
out of the sky on your way from Souix City, IA to Des Moines ... :-)


Cooperating with Riley Rainey and the ACM devel team:

Ideally, we would join forces and work together with the ACM devel
team.  However, integrating our efforts with the ACM devel team might
prove to be difficult.  This is Riley Rainey's program and he does
most of the work on it.  I don't mean this in a negative way at all.
He wrote the program, he should be able to manage and control it's
development in any way that suits him.  I wrote a freeware check book
balancer and know exactly how he feels.  On the down side, Riley is
currently very busy with his real job and doesn't have a lot of time
to put into acm.  The pieces of the source are not very modular, so it
currently would be difficult to have multiple people working on it at
the same time.

One option, would be to take the current source, or wait for the soon
to be released version, and branch off in our own direction.  This
would be fine, as long as we adhere to the GNU general public license
under which ACM is licensed.

We could split everything apart into logical modules (we have
previously discussed various breakdowns.)  From that point we could
just start going to it.


Then what:

Initially, we would want to carefully separate out the generic
graphics routines from the system specific graphics routines, and
organize things so we can easily port to new graphics systems.  Then
we could try to port the rest of it (or as much of the rest of it as
possible) to DOS.  We would want to look at how scenery and objects
are represented.  We would want to add real instrument panels, and
look at adding more joystick and sound support.

I think all the weaknesses which I previously addressed are very
addressable ... especially if we can modularize the code so we can all
work on different sections concurrently.


Then what:

By now we have a kick butt, world famous flight simulator.  Microsoft,
already devestated by the Caldera/Dr. DOS lawsuit, watches sales of
it's last best money making hope (FS6) dwindle.  Meanwhile, Bill Gates
baracades himself in his office as the forces of good close in on all
sides ... ok, I'll stop before any physical harm befalls Bill and I
lose my "G" rating.


So,

Check out the screen shots, have a look at the ACM home page, if you
can and if you want to, compile and run ACM, then let me know what you
think about this idea.

Thanks,

Curt.

Hi Curt:

Just my thoughts on this subject before I take off here for the month of
August on business again :-(

At 01:52 PM 7/31/96 -0500, you wrote:
>Comments:

This in and of itself may not be a bad idea, since you could in essence
assit Riley with the port of ACM to the DOS world.  Then you would have a
program engine that support both combat and non combat situations!  Take
that MI$ :-)

I understand your concerns about his feelings and lack of time, but he may
be amicable to the suggestion.  The only way to find out is to ask.

I would consider the following:  Study (aka analysis paralysis) to see what
would really be involved in porting the code to a dos environment.  I
presume ACM was written in C?  I would also consider cross porting back to
the LINUX environment.  Now we can really kick MI$'s butt! :-)  If you think
that the new version would have some major changes made to it, then wait for
it, but I have to let you be the judge of that.

>We could split everything apart into logical modules (we have

You guys are the code heads, and I would leave those decisions to you, but
looking at it from a time line standpoint I see the following benefits with
your proposal:

1.  We would gain much time in the development front, since we (meaning the
coders) would not need to start working from scratch.

2.  From what you describe of ACM's attributes, it has many of the features
that I have seen discussed on this list (the only one I do not unsub from
during my trips!)  This in and of itself would help you in reducing the
effort required (If my feeble mind understands this correctly).

3.  If Mr Riley would not object, when the system is modularized, it would
be possible to port to many other OS's, since I would presume that the
graphics interface section is what would need to be customized for the
different OS platforms.  Although I know our intentions was to stick to a
dos based platform, This would give you the flexibility to run on OS's or
machines that may provide soem performance enhancments other than the ISA
architecture.  (Of course, not all of us are lucky enough to have a silicone
graphics or sun machine at home, but hey, its a thought is it not?)
