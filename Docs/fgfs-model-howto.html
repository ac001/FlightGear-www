<DIV>
<H3>Introduction</H3>

<BR>This mini-HOWTO explains how to add 3D aircraft models to
FlightGear, and how to animate and position those models.  No C++
programming is required, but the user will need some knowledge of
FlightGear's property system and XML markup, and will need to
understand the coordinate system FlightGear uses for its models:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>distances are in meters</LI>
<LI>angles are in degrees</LI>
<LI>the x-axis runs lengthwise, towards the back</LI>
<LI>the y-axis runs sideways, towards the right</LI>
<LI>the z-axis runs upwards</LI>
<LI>heading is a rotation around the z-axis, where positive is
clockwise viewed from above</LI>
<LI>pitch is a rotation around the y-axis, where positive is clockwise
viewed from the left</LI>
<LI>roll is a rotation around the x-axis, where positive is clockwise
viewed from behind</LI>
</UL>

<P>[[TODO: will someone volunteer to draw diagrams?]]</P>

</DIV>


<DIV><A NAME="loading"></A>
<H3>1. Loading the model</H3>

<P>Through <A HREF="http://plib.sourceforge.net/">plib</A>, FlightGear
supports many different 3D file formats, including VRML1, AC3D, DXF,
MDL (from <CITE>Microsoft Flight Simulator</CITE>), and many others.
The property <VAR>/sim/model/path</VAR> in the main FlightGear
property tree controls what model will be loaded; it takes
a string value giving the relative path of the model from
<VAR>FG_ROOT</VAR> (the root of the base package, such as
<CODE>/usr/local/share/FlightGear</CODE> or
<CODE>C:\FLIGHTGEAR\</CODE>).</P>

<P>The easiest way to load a new model is to set the property at
startup with the <VAR>--prop:</VAR> command-line option; for example,
to use a 3D aircraft model that you have installed in
<CODE>$FG_ROOT/Models/my-cessna.wrl</CODE>, you could invoke
FlightGear like this (under Unix-like systems):</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
fgfs --prop:/sim/model/path=Models/my-cessna.wrl
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>(<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Normally all textures used by the model must appear
in the same directory.  If <CODE>my-cessna.wrl</CODE> uses the
textures <CODE>cessna01.rgb</CODE> and <CODE>cessna02.rgb</CODE>, you
should also install those textures in <CODE>$FG_ROOT/Models/</CODE>. 
It is howerever possible to specify a path (relative to the model path) 
to specify where the textures could be found.)</P>

<P>When you want to set a 3D model permanently as the default for an
aircraft rather than specifying it on the command line, you need to
edit an aircraft settings file.  In the
<CODE>$FG_ROOT/Aircraft/</CODE> directory there is a series of files
ending in <CODE>-set.xml</CODE>, such as <CODE>c172-set.xml</CODE>,
<CODE>dc3-yasim-set.xml</CODE>, and <CODE>beech99-uiuc-set.xml</CODE>.
When you start FlightGear with the <VAR>--aircraft</VAR> option, it
reads the properties from one of these files; for example</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
fgfs --aircraft=dc3-yasim
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Loads the properties from
<CODE>$FG_ROOT/Aircraft/dc3-yasim-set.xml</CODE> into the main
FlightGear property tree.  These files are in the same XML
property-list format as <CODE>$FG_ROOT/preferences.xml</CODE> and the
FlightGear save files.  There may be many XML files with different
startup conditions, sounds, panels, 3D models, etc. for any single
aircraft type, so you are best off copying an existing one, renaming
it, then changing the value inside the <VAR>path</VAR> element inside
<VAR>model</VAR> inside <VAR>sim</VAR>:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;PropertyList>
 &lt;sim>
  &lt;model>
   &lt;path>Models/my-cessna.wrl&lt;/path>
   &lt;texture-path>./Textures&lt;/texture-path>
  &lt;/model>
 &lt;/sim>
&lt;/PropertyList>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>So far, all of the examples have had the <VAR>/sim/model/path</VAR>
property point directly at the 3D model file
(<CODE>Models/my-cessna.wrl</CODE>); however, if you want to be able
to reposition or animate the model, you need to point to an
intermediate XML file instead, and then put the repositioning and
animation information into the XML file.  Here's a simple example of a
3D-model wrapper file, with no repositioning or animation
information:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;PropertyList>
 &lt;path>my-cessna.wrl&lt;/path>
 &lt;texture-path>./Textures&lt;/texture-path>
&lt;/PropertyList>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Like the <VAR>-set.xml</VAR> files, this file is in XML property
list format, but the properties in it are not added to the main
FlightGear property tree; they're used only while loading the
model.  The following sections will explain how to add repositioning
and animation information to the file; for now, the only property to
worry about is <VAR>path</VAR>: it provides the relative path to the
actual 3D file from the XML wrapper file (<STRONG>not</STRONG> from
<VAR>FG_ROOT</VAR>!).  Usually, you should put the wrapper file in the
same directory as the 3D file, and then have
<VAR>/sim/model/path</VAR> point to the wrapper file, either on the
command line</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
fgfs --prop:/sim/model/path=Models/my-cessna.xml
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>or in the <CODE>-set.xml</CODE> file:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;PropertyList>
 &lt;sim>
  &lt;model>
   &lt;path>Models/my-cessna.xml&lt;/path>
  &lt;/model>
 &lt;/sim>
&lt;/PropertyList>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!-- end of "Loading the model" -->
</DIV>


<DIV><A NAME="repositioning"></A>
<H3>2. Repositioning the Model</H3>

<P>Often, an aircraft model not designed specifically for FlightGear
will not be positioned or oriented correctly; for example, it might be
too far off the ground, and the nose might point to the side or even
straight up.</P>

<P>Inside the XML wrapper file (<EM>not</EM> the main FlightGear
property tree), there are six properties that allow you to tweak the
default position and orientation of the model:</P>

<DL COMPACT="compact">

<DT><STRONG>/offsets/x-m</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The distance to reposition the model along the x-axis.</DD>

<DT><STRONG>/offsets/y-m</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The distance to reposition the model along the y-axis.</DD>

<DT><STRONG>/offsets/z-m</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The distance to reposition the model along the z-axis.</DD>

<DT><STRONG>/offsets/heading-deg</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The angle by which to rotate the model around the z-axis.</DD>

<DT><STRONG>/offsets/roll-deg</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The angle by which to rotate the model around the x-axis.</DD>

<DT><STRONG>/offsets/pitch-deg</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The angle by which to rotate the model around the y-axis.</DD>

</DL>

<P>For example, if you wanted to use the 3D model
<CODE>my-cessna.wrl</CODE> but found that the nose was pointing to the
right instead of straight-ahead and the wheels were 1.5 meters off the
ground, you could reorient it in the XML wrapper file like this:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;PropertyList>
 &lt;sim>
  &lt;model>
   &lt;path>Models/my-cessna.xml&lt;/path>
  &lt;/model>
 &lt;/sim>
 &lt;offsets>
  &lt;heading-offset-deg>270&lt;/heading-offset-deg>
  &lt;z-offset-m>-1.5&lt;/z-offset-m>
 &lt;/offsets>
&lt;/PropertyList>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It usually takes a bit of experimentation to get the model
positioned correctly.</P>

<!-- end of "Repositioning the Model" -->
</DIV>


<DIV><A NAME="animating"></A>
<H3>3. Animating the Model</H3>

<P>Now for the interesting part.  FlightGear allows you to animate
models by having parts rotate or spin in response to property changes:
for example, the propellers can spin when the engine is on and the
elevators can move up and down with your controller.  There is no
fixed limit on what parts can be animated: the only requirements are
that the part is named in the 3D model file, and that there is a
property in the main tree that you can use to get the positioning
information.</P>

<P>Currently, there are three types of animation recognized:</P>

<OL>
<LI>none</LI>
<LI>spin</LI>
<LI>rotate</LI>
</OL>

<P>In the future, many more will be added, but the last two are
sufficient for animating the main control surfaces of many
standard-configuration aircraft.  <VAR>none</VAR> is a no-op;
<VAR>spin</VAR> rotates the object around an axis with a known
rotational velocity (not worrying about the exact position), and
<VAR>rotate</VAR> rotates the object around an axis to an exact
position.</P>

<P>Every animation appears inside an <VAR>animation</VAR> element, and
contains a <VAR>type</VAR> property and at least one
<VAR>object-name</VAR> property:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;animation>
 &lt;type>rotation&lt;/type>
 &lt;object-name>Rudder&lt;/object-name>
&lt;/animation>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The object name must match exactly the object name used in the 3D
file (including case).  You may include more than one object name to
apply the same transformation to more than one object, assuming that
they rotate around exactly the same line:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;animation>
 &lt;type>rotation&lt;/type>
 &lt;object-name>LeftElevator&lt;/object-name>
 &lt;object-name>RightElevator&lt;/object-name>
&lt;/animation>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Each animation must be associated with exactly one property from
the main FlightGear property tree (remember that the properties in the
wrapper file are not part of the main tree), using <VAR>property</VAR>
to provide the property name:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;animation>
 &lt;type>rotation&lt;/type>
 &lt;object-name>Rudder&lt;/object-name>
 &lt;property>controls/rudder&lt;/property>
&lt;/animation>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Note the omission of the leading slash '/' when reffering to the property. 
This assures that when the model is used for AI traffic the animations will 
follow that of the AI controller instead of that of the user.<P>
This example rotates the rudder according to the value of the
<VAR>controls/rudder</VAR> property (or at least, it will when we
specify the center and axis of rotation below); however,
<VAR>controls/rudder</VAR> is normalized from -1.0 to 1.0, and we
probably want to rotate the rudder more than that; as a result, we
need to use the <VAR>factor</VAR> property to do scaling.  For
example, if the rudder on the actual aircraft rotates 18 degrees in
each direction, we would use a factor of 18 to scale the rudder
position from -18 degrees to 18 degrees:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;animation>
 &lt;type>rotation&lt;/type>
 &lt;object-name>Rudder&lt;/object-name>
 &lt;property>controls/rudder&lt;/property>
 &lt;factor>18&lt;/factor>
&lt;/animation>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If you wanted to reverse the direction of rudder movement, you
would use a factor of -18.</P>

<P>There is also an <VAR>offset</VAR> property that can be useful for
starting the rotation from a point other than center.  For example,
let's say that you want the rudder to start 1% to the left rather than
dead center; you could specify that like this:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;animation>
 &lt;type>rotation&lt;/type>
 &lt;object-name>Rudder&lt;/object-name>
 &lt;property>controls/rudder&lt;/property>
 &lt;offset>-0.01&lt;/offset>
 &lt;factor>18&lt;/factor>
&lt;/animation>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The offset is applied <EM>before</EM> the factor.</P>

<P>Finally, there are <VAR>min</VAR> and <VAR>max</VAR> properties
that can constrain the amount of rotation in degrees, as in this (very
complicated) example for the Cessna 310 landing gear:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;animation>
 &lt;type>rotate&lt;/type>
 &lt;object-name>NoseWheel&lt;/object-name>
 &lt;property>gear/gear[0]/position-norm&lt;/property>
 &lt;factor>120&lt;/factor>
 &lt;offset>-1&lt;/offset>
 &lt;min>-90&lt;/min>
 &lt;max>0&lt;/max>
 &lt;center>
  &lt;x-m>-2.28&lt;/x-m>
  &lt;y-m>0.0&lt;/y-m>
  &lt;z-m>-0.65&lt;/z-m>
 &lt;/center>
 &lt;axis>
  &lt;x>0&lt;/x>
  &lt;y>1&lt;/y>
  &lt;z>0&lt;/z>
 &lt;/axis>
&lt;/animation>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In this example, the gear position (from 0.0 for fully retracted to
1.0 for fully extended) is multiplied by a factor of 120 and an offset
of -1, then clamped to between -90 and 0.  In the 3D model, the gear
is extended by default, so we end up with the following rotations
through the gear's range of movement:</P>

<TABLE BORDER="border">

<TR>
<TH>position-norm</TH>
<TH>+ offset -1</TH>
<TH>* factor 120</TH>
<TH>clamped to min/max -90:0</TH>
<TH>comments</TH>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>0.0</TD>
<TD>-1.0</TD>
<TD>-120.0</TD>
<TD>-90.0</TD>
<TD>fully retracted</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>0.25</TD>
<TD>-0.75</TD>
<TD>-90.0</TD>
<TD>-90.0</TD>
<TD>still retracted</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>0.5</TD>
<TD>-0.5</TD>
<TD>-60.0</TD>
<TD>-50.0</TD>
<TD>1/3 extended</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>0.75</TD>
<TD>-0.25</TD>
<TD>-30.0</TD>
<TD>-30.0</TD>
<TD>2/3 extended</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>1.0</TD>
<TD>0.0</TD>
<TD>0.0</TD>
<TD>0.0</TD>
<TD>fully extended (default position)</TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>

<P>The gear does not move at all during the first 1/4 of the
position-norm value, giving the doors a chance to open and close in a
separate animation.  Obviously, this would be easier to manage with an
interpolation table, and future versions of the model animation will
likely support interpolation.</P>

<P>For a <VAR>spin</VAR> animation, the property provides a value in
revolutions per minute (RPM) rather than an absolute position in
degrees, and offset is not used.  You can still use <VAR>factor</VAR>
to scale the property value if it is not in RPM.</P>

<P>Now, it is necessary to specify the axis of rotation for the
object, its virtual hinge.  This is often the hardest part, requiring
a lot of trial-and-error when the axis of rotation is not lined up
with the x-, y-, or z- axis (think of ailerons on a swept wing with a
non-zero dihedral angle).  You need to provide two groups of
information: a point through which the axis of rotation passes, and
the direction in which the axis is moving.</P>

<P>For the point through which the axis passes, you use the
<VAR>/center/x-m</VAR>, <VAR>/center/y-m</VAR>, and
<VAR>/center/z-m</VAR> properties to specify a position in meters,
using the aircraft's coordinate system.  Note that this is the system
before repositioning: if the original model was pointing sideways,
then your fuselage will run along the y-axis rather than the
x-axis.  Here is an example for a rudder:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;animation>
 &lt;type>rotate&lt;/type>
 &lt;object-name>Rudder&lt;/object-name>
 &lt;property>controls/rudder&lt;/property>
 &lt;factor>18&lt;/factor>
 &lt;center>
  &lt;x-m>5.45&lt;/x-m>
  &lt;y-m>0.0&lt;/y-m>
  &lt;z-m>0.0&lt;/z-m>
 &lt;/center>
&lt;/animation>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In this example, the point is right on the y and z axes, but 5.45
meters along the x axis (i.e. towards the back of the plane).</P>

<P>Finally, in addition to the center point, it's necessary to specify
the direction of the axis that passes through it, using the properties
<VAR>/axis/x</VAR>, <VAR>/axis/y</VAR>, and <VAR>axis/z</VAR>.  These
are unitless values showing the rate of change in each direction; for
example, a straight up-and-down rotational axis could be specified
like this:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;axis>
 &lt;x>0&lt;/x>
 &lt;y>0&lt;/y>
 &lt;z>1&lt;/z>
&lt;/axis>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>or like this:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;axis>
 &lt;x>0&lt;/x>
 &lt;y>0&lt;/y>
 &lt;z>1000000&lt;/z>
&lt;/axis>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Since there's 0 movement along the other two axes, it doesn't
matter.  On the other hand, let's say that the rudder hinge sloped
back 5% because of a swept tail.  In that case, the x-axis would have
to show some movement as well:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;axis>
 &lt;x>0.05&lt;/x>
 &lt;y>0&lt;/y>
 &lt;z>1&lt;/z>
&lt;/axis>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>That could just as easily be written as</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;axis>
 &lt;x>1&lt;/x>
 &lt;y>0&lt;/y>
 &lt;z>20&lt;/z>
&lt;/axis>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>as long as the ratios are the same.  For a complicated rotation
axis, like that for an aileron on a swept-back wing with a significant
dihedral angle, you'll have to specify movement along all three
axes:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;axis>
 &lt;x>0.15&lt;/x>
 &lt;y>1.00&lt;/y>
 &lt;z>0.01&lt;/z>
&lt;/axis>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Here's a complete example, showing the animation for the rudder on
the Cessna 172:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;animation>
 &lt;type>rotate&lt;/type>
 &lt;object-name>Rudder&lt;/object-name>
 &lt;property>controls/rudder&lt;/property>
 &lt;factor>18&lt;/factor>
 &lt;center>
  &lt;x-m>5.45&lt;/x-m>
  &lt;y-m>0.0&lt;/y-m>
  &lt;z-m>0.0&lt;/z-m>
 &lt;/center>
 &lt;axis>
  &lt;x>0.72&lt;/x>
  &lt;y>0.0&lt;/y>
  &lt;z>1.0&lt;/z>
 &lt;/axis>
&lt;/animation>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>And here's an example of a spin, using the Cessna 172
propeller:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;animation>
 &lt;type>spin&lt;/type>
 &lt;object-name>Propeller&lt;/object-name>
 &lt;property>engines/engine[0]/rpm&lt;/property>
 &lt;center>
  &lt;x-m>0&lt;/x-m>
  &lt;y-m>0&lt;/y-m>
  &lt;z-m>-.25&lt;/z-m>
 &lt;/center>
 &lt;axis>
  &lt;x>1.0&lt;/x>
  &lt;y>0.0&lt;/y>
  &lt;z>0.0&lt;/z>
 &lt;/axis>
&lt;/animation>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>You can get a lot of your initial measurements by viewing the model
in a 3D editor like <A
HREF="http://prettypoly.sourceforge.net/">PPE</A>, and you can also
use PPE to name or rename objects so that you can animate them in
FlightGear.  In the end, though, you'll almost have to do a little
tweaking by trial and error until everything looks right.</P>

<P>This document will likely be out of date by the time you read it.
Look at the actual XML wrapper files (currently in
<CODE>$FG_ROOT/Aircraft/<EM>aircraft-type</EM>/Models/</CODE>) to look
at how FlightGear is doing things now.  In the future, we'll be adding
other animation types, including selecting among different versions of
the same object (such as a translucent propeller disk for high RPM),
non-rotational transformations, scaling, and conditionals (i.e. draw
engine exhaust only above a certain velocity).</P>
