<H1>Introduction to FlightGear</H1>

<P CLASS="indent">
The <B>FlightGear</B> flight simulator project is an open-source,
multi-platform, cooperative flight simulator development project.
Source code for the entire project is available and licensed under the
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License</A>.
</P>

<P CLASS="indent">
The goal of the <B>FlightGear</B> project is to create a sophisticated
flight simulator framework for use in research or academic
environments, for the development and pursuit of other interesting
flight simulation ideas, and as an end-user application.  We are
developing a sophisticated, open simulation framework that can be
expanded and improved upon by anyone interested in contributing.
</P>

<P CLASS="indent">
There are many exciting possibilities for an open, free flight sim.  We
hope that this project will be interesting and useful to many people
in many areas.


<H1>Project Overview</H1>

FlightGear is a free flight simulator project.  It is being developed
through the gracious contributions of source code and spare time by
many talented people from around the globe.  Among the many goals of
this project are the quest to minimize short cuts and "do things
right", the quest to learn and advance knowledge, and the quest to
have better toys to play with.
<P>

The idea for Flight Gear was born out of a dissatisfaction with
current commercial PC flight simulators.  A big problem with these
simulators is their proprietariness and lack of extensibility.  There
are so many people across the world with great ideas for enhancing the
currently available simulators who have the ability to write code, and
who have a desire to learn and contribute.  Many people involved in
education and research could use a spiffy flight simulator frame work
on which to build their own projects; however, commercial simulators
do not lend themselves to modification and enhancement.  The Flight
Gear project is striving to fill these gaps.
<P>

There are a wide range of people interested and participating in this
project. This is truly a global effort with contributors from just
about every continent. Interests range from building a realistic home
simulator out old airplane parts, to university research and
instructional use, to simply having a viable alternative to commercial
PC simulators.
<P>

Flight Gear and its source code have intentionally been kept open,
available, and free. In doing so, we are able to take advantage of
the efforts of tremendously talented people from around the world.
Contrast this with the traditional approach of commercial software
vendors, who are limited by the collective ability of the people they
can hire and pay. Our approach brings its own unique challenges and
difficulties, but we are confident (and other similarly structured
projects have demonstrated) that in the long run we can outclass the
commercial "competition."
<P>

Contributing to Flight Gear can be educational and a lot of fun. A
long time developer, Curtis Olson, had this to say about working on
Flight Gear:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Personally, Flight Gear has been a great learning experience for me. I
have been exposed to many new ideas and have learned a tremendous
amount of "good stuff" in the process of discussing and implementing
various Flight Gear subsystems. If for no other reason, this alone
makes it all worth while.
