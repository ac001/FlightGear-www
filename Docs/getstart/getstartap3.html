advantage is its platform independence, i. e., programs written with OpenGL<a

be compiled and executed on several platforms, given the proper drivers having been

get it running (except to &#xFB01;nd older OpenGL drivers somewhere on the net or

<!--l. 151--><p class="noindent">Notably, with 3DFX<a 
 id="dx17-125001"></a> now having been taken over by NVIDIA<a 
 id="dx17-125002"></a>, manufacturer&#8217;s support
already has disappeared. However with XFree86-4.x (with x at least being greater than 1)
Voodoo3 cards are known to be pretty usable in 16 bit color mode. Newer cards should
work &#xFB01;ne as well. If you are still running a version of Xfree86 3.X and run into problems,
consider an upgrade. The recent distributions by Debian or SuSE have been reported to
work well.

href="getstart.html#QQ2-17-145" id="x17-126000C.6">ATI chip based cards under Linux</a></h3>
<!--l. 163--><p class="noindent">There is support for ATI<a 
 id="dx17-126001"></a> chips in XFree86-4.1 and greater. Lots of AGP boards based on
the Rage128 chip - from simple Rage128 board to ATI Xpert2000 - are mostly usable for
FlightGear. Since XFree86-4.1 you can use early Radeon chips - up to Radeon7500 with
XFree86-4.2, up to Radeon9100 with XFree86-4.3. Be careful with stock XFree86-4.3.0,
it was released with (known) bugs in the Radeon driver. Ongoing development provides
functional drivers for R100 (Radeon7000 up to 7500) and R200 (Radeon8500 and 9100)
chips.
<!--l. 172--><p class="indent">   ATI provides an alternative with their binary drivers. You need to build a kernel
module using a script that is supplied with the package and add several X server modules
into your XFree86 tree. In most cases, the RPM installation will do that for
you.

href="getstart.html#QQ2-17-146" id="x17-127000C.7">Building your own OpenGL support under Linux</a></h3>
<!--l. 181--><p class="noindent">Setting up proper OpenGL support<a 
 id="dx17-127001"></a> with a recent Linux distribution should be pretty
simple. As an example SuSE<a 
 id="dx17-127002"></a> ships everything you need plus some small shell scripts to
adjust the missing bits automagically. If you just want to execute pre-built binaries of
FlightGear, then you&#8217;re done by using the supplied <span 
class="ptmbi8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>package plus the
mandantory runtime libraries (and kernel modules). The package manager will tell you
which ones to choose.
<!--l. 189--><p class="indent">   In case you want to run a self-made kernel, you want to compile <span 
class="ptmbi8t-x-x-109">FlightGear</span>
yourself, you&#8217;re tweaking your X server con&#xFB01;guration &#xFB01;le yourself or you even run a
homebrewed Linux &#8220;distribution&#8221; (this means, you want to compile everything yourself),
this chapter might be useful for you.
<!--l. 195--><p class="indent">   Now let&#8217;s have a look at the parts that build OpenGL support on Linux. First there&#8217;s a
Linux kernel with support for your graphics adapter.
<!--l. 198--><p class="indent">   Examples on which graphics hardware is supported natively by Open Source drivers
are provided on
<!--l. 202--><p class="noindent"><a 
href="http://dri.sourceforge.net/dri_status.phtml" >http://dri.sourceforge.net/dri_status.phtml</a>.
                                                                     

                                                                     
<!--l. 206--><p class="indent">   There are a few graphics chip families that are not directly or no more than partly
supported by XFree86<a 
 id="dx17-127003"></a>, the X window implementation on Linux, because vendors don&#8217;t
like to provide programming information on their chips. In these cases - notably
IBM/DIAMOND/now: ATI<a 
 id="dx17-127004"></a> FireGL graphics boards and NVIDIA<a 
 id="dx17-127005"></a> GeForce based cards -
you depend on the manufacturers will to follow the ongoing development of the XFree86
graphics display infrastructure. These boards might prove to deliver impressing
performance but in many cases - considering the CPU&#8217;s speed you &#xFB01;nd in today&#8217;s
PC&#8217;s - you have many choices which all lead to respectable performance of
<span 
class="ptmbi8t-x-x-109">FlightGear</span>.
<!--l. 217--><p class="indent">   As long as you use a distribution provided kernel, you can expect to &#xFB01;nd all
necessary kernel modules at the appropriate location. If you compile the kernel yourself,
then you have to take care of two sub-menus in the kernel con&#xFB01;guration menu. You&#8217;ll
&#xFB01;nd them in the &#8220;Character devices&#8221; menu. Please notice that AGP support is not
compulsory for hardware accelerated OpenGL support on Linux. This also works quite
&#xFB01;ne with some PCI cards (3dfx<a 
 id="dx17-127006"></a> Voodoo3 PCI for example, in case you still own one).
Although every modern PC graphics card utilizes the AGP &#8216;bus&#8217; for fast data
transfer.
<!--l. 226--><p class="indent">   Besides &#8221;AGP Support<a 
 id="dx17-127007"></a>&#8221; for your chipset - you might want to ask your mainboard
manual which one is on - you de&#xFB01;nitely want to activate &#8220;Direct Rendering Manager&#8221;
for your graphics board. Please note that recent releases of XFree86 - namely
4.1.0 and higher might not be supported by the DRI included in older Linux
kernels. Also newer 2.4.x kernels from 2.4.8 up to 2.4.17 do not support DRI in
XFree86-4.0.x.
<!--l. 233--><p class="indent">   After building and installing your kernel modules and the kernel itself this task might
be completed by loading the &#8216;agpgart&#8217; module manually or, in case you linked it into the
kernel, by a reboot in purpose to get the new kernel up and running. While booting your
kernel on an AGP capable mainboard you may expect boot messages like this one:
<!--l. 241--><p class="noindent"><span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">&gt; Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann</span>
<br class="newline"><span

<br class="newline"><span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">&gt; agpgart: AGP aperture is 64M @ 0xe4000000</span>
<!--l. 249--><p class="indent">   If you don&#8217;t encounter such messages on Linux kernel boot, then you might have
missed the right chip set. Part one of activation hardware accelerated OpenGL support on
your Linux system is now completed.
<!--l. 252--><p class="indent">   The second part consists of con&#xFB01;guring your X server<a 
 id="dx17-127008"></a> for OpenGL&#x1E6A;his is not a big
deal as it simply consists of to instructions to load the appropriate modules on startup of
the X server. This is done by editing the con&#xFB01;guration &#xFB01;le <span

Today&#8217;s Linux distributions are supposed to provide a tool that does this job
for you on your demand. Please make sure there are these two instructions:

the X server will take care of loading the appropriate Linux kernel module for
DRI support of your graphics card. The right Linux kernel module name is
determined by the &#8216;Driver&#8217; statement in the &#8220;Device&#8221; section of the XF86Con&#xFB01;g.

set to &#8220;1:0:0&#8221; - because you only have one AGP slot on your board - whereas the PCI<a

BusID differs with the slot your graphics card has been applied to. &#8216;lspci&#8217; might be your
friend in desperate situations. Also a look at the end of /var/log/XFree86.0.log, which
should be written on X server startup, should point to the PCI slot where your card
resides.

sufficient to run existing appliactions. For compiling FlightGear you also need the suiting
developmental headers. As compiling the whole X window system is not subject to this
abstract we expect that your distribution ships the necessary libraries and headers. In case
you told your package manager to install some sort of OpenGL support you are
supposed to &#xFB01;nd some OpenGL test utilities, at least there should be &#8216;glxinfo&#8217; or
&#8216;gl-info&#8217;.

dealt with in a software library running solely on your CPU&#x0130;n this case you might want
to have a closer look at the preceding paragraphs of this chapter. Now please
make sure all necessary libraries are at their proper location. You will need three

of the programs that accompany the drivers, to be absolutely con&#xFB01;dent that
it is functioning well. There are also many little programs, often available as
screen savers, that can be used for testing. It is important that you are con&#xFB01;dent
in your graphics acceleration because <span

fast as possible. If your drivers aren&#8217;t working well, or are unstable, you will
have difficulty tracking down the source of any problems and have a frustrating
time.
