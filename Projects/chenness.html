Please visit the main project home page for complete information and
lots of interesting stuff.  The following is copied from Craig's web
page.
<P>

The FireMite is an autonomously controlled RC airplane. The FireMite
project is part of the Simon Fraser University Aerial Robotics
Group. The name FireMite was chosen as the plane is smaller than the
FireFly (another ARG plane), and for the fact that it Mite work or it
Mite not :). (Oh it'll work)
<P>

The SFU ARG is a competitor in the International Aerial Robotics
Competition which is held annually in Richland, Washington. The goal
of the competition is to fly an autonomous vehicle and perform search
and rescue functions.
<P>

The simulation system is a vitally important component of the FireMite
system. It simulates the flight characteristics of a real airplane (a
Cessna). The simulation system allows for the testing of control code
for various flight procedures such as takeoff, flight patterns,
landing, and will allow for variable wind conditions. The output is
logged to a file for further analysis with graphing software
(Excel).
