A wire frame image showing an example of how the
terrain is tesselated.  If you look closely you can see that
polygon size is quite variable.  Terrain areas of greater
complexity require a finer mesh to maintain a preset level of
accuracy.  Also note, the moon is hiding below the surface, but
is exposed because of the wireframe rendering.
