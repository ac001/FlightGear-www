<!--l. 18--><p class="indent">   The helicopter flight model of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>is quite realistic. The only exceptions are
&#8220;vortex ring conditions&#8221;. These occur if you descend too fast and perpendicularly
(without forward speed). The heli can get into its own rotor downwash causing the lift to
be substantially reduced. Recovering from this condition is possible only at higher
altitudes. On the Internet you can find a video of a Seaking helicopter, which got into this
condition during a flight demonstration and touched down so hard afterwards that it was
completely destroyed.
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent">   For all <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>helicopters the parameters are not completely optimized and thus
the performance data between model and original can deviate slightly. On the hardware
side I recommend the use of a &#8220;good&#8221; joystick. A joystick without springs is
recommended because it will not center by itself. You can either remove the spring from
a normal joystick, or use a force feedback joystick, with a disconnected voltage supply.
Further, the joystick should have a &#8220;thrust controller&#8221; (throttle). For controlling
the tail rotor you should have pedals or at least a twistable joystick - using a
keyboard is hard. <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>supports multiple joysticks attached at the same
time.

<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent">The number of available helicopters in <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>is limited. In my opinion the Bo105 is
the easiest to fly, since it reacts substantially more directly than other helicopters. For
flight behavior I can also recommend the S76C. The S76C reacts more retarded than the
Bo.
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent">   Once you have loaded <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear</span>, take a moment to centralize the controls
by moving them around. In particular the collective is often at maximum on
startup.

<!--l. 50--><p class="indent">   The helicopter is controlled by four functions. The stick (joystick) controls two of
them, the inclination of the rotor disc (and thus the inclination of the helicopter) to the
right/left and forwards/back. Together these functions are called &#8220;cyclic blade control&#8221;.
Next there is the &#8220;collective blade control&#8221;, which is controlled by the thrust controller.
This causes a change of the thrust produced by the rotor. Since the powering of the main
rotor transfers a torque to the fuselage, this must be compensated by the tail rotor. Since
the torque is dependent on the collective and on the flight condition as well as the wind
on the fuselage, the tail rotor is also controlled by the pilot using the pedals. If you
push the right pedal, the helicopter turns to the right (!). The pedals are not a
steering wheel. Using the pedals you can yaw helicopter around the vertical
axis. The number of revolutions of the rotor is kept constant (if possible) by the
aircraft.

href="getstart.html#QQ2-30-220" id="x30-18300010.3">Lift-Off</a></h3>
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent">First reduce the collective to minimum. To increase the rotor thrust, you have to &#8220;pull&#8221;
the collective. Therefore for minimum collective you have to push the control down (that
is the full acceleration position (!) of the thrust controller). Equally, &#8220;full power&#8221;
has the thrust controller at idle. Start the engine with <span 
class="pcrb8t-x-x-109">}</span>. After few seconds the
rotor will start to turn and accelerates slowly. Keep the stick and the pedals
approximately centered. Wait until the rotor has finished accelerating. For the
Bo105 there is an instruments for engine and rotor speed on the left of the upper
row.
<!--l. 78--><p class="indent">   Once rotor acceleration is complete, pull the collective very slowly. Keep your eye on
the horizon. If the heli tilts or turns even slightly, stop increasing the collective and
correct the position/movement with stick and pedals. If you are successful, continue
pulling the collective (slowly!).
<!--l. 83--><p class="indent">   As the helicopter takes off, increase the collective a little bit more and try to keep the
helicopter in a leveled position. The main challenge is reacting to the inadvertent rotating
motion of the helicopter with the correct control inputs. Only three things can help you:
practice, practice and practice. It is quite common for it to take hours of practice to
achieve a halfway good looking hovering flight. Note: The stick position in a stable hover
is not the center position of the joystick.
<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent">
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10.4    </span> <a 
href="getstart.html#QQ2-30-221" id="x30-18400010.4">In the air</a></h3>
<!--l. 93--><p class="noindent">To avoid the continual frustration of trying to achieve level flight, you may want to try
forward flight. After take off continue pulling the collective a short time and then
lower the nose a slightly using the control stick. The helicopter will accelerate
forward. With forward speed the tail rotor does not have to be controlled as
precisely due to the relative wind coming from directly ahead. Altogether the
flight behavior in forward flight is quite similar to that of an badly trimmed
                                                                     

                                                                     
airplane. The &#8220;neutral&#8221; position of the stick will depend upon airspeed and
collective.
<!--l. 102--><p class="indent">   Transitioning from forward flight to hovering is easiest if you reduce speed slowly by
raising the nose of the helicopter. At the same time, reduce the collective to stop the
helicopter from climbing. As the helicopter slows, &#8220;translation lift&#8221; is reduced, and you
will have to compensate by pulling the collective. When the speed is nearly zero, lower
the nose to the position it was when hovering. Otherwise the helicopter will accelerate
backwards!

href="getstart.html#QQ2-30-222" id="x30-18500010.5">Back to Earth I</a></h3>
<!--l. 111--><p class="noindent">To land the helicopter transition to a hover as described above while reducing the altitude
using the collective. Briefly before hitting the ground reduce the rate of descent slowly. A
perfect landing is achieved if you managed to zero the altitude, speed and descent
rate at the same time (gently). However, such landing are extremely difficult.
Most pilots perform a hover more or less near to the ground and then decent
slowly to the ground. Landing with forward velocity is easier, however you must
make sure you don&#8217;t land with any lateral (sideways) component to avoid a
rollover.

<!--l. 124--><p class="noindent">It is worth mentioning autoration briefly. This is a unpowered flight condition, where the
flow of air through the rotors rotates the rotor itelf. At an appropriate altitude select a
landing point (at first in the size of a larger airfield) and then switch the engine off by
pressing <span 
class="pcrb8t-x-x-109">{</span>. Reduce collective to minimum, place the tail rotor to approximately 0<sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">&#x2218;</span></sup>
incidence (with the Bo push the right pedal about half, with As350 the left). Approach at
                                                                     

                                                                     
approximately 80 knots. Don&#8217;t allow the rotor speed to rise more than a few
percent over 100%, otherwise the rotor will be damaged (though this is not
currently simulated). As you reach the ground, reduce the airspeed by lifting the
nose. The descent rate will drop at the same time, so you do not need to pull the
collective. It may be the case that the rotor speed rises beyond the permitted range.
Counteract this by raising the collective if required. Just above the ground, reduce the
descent rate by pulling the collective. The goal is it to touch down with a very
low descent rate and no forward speed. With forward speed it is easier, but
there is a danger of a roll over if the skids are not aligned parallel to the flight
direction. During the approach it is not necessary to adjust the tail rotor, since
without power there is almost no torque. If you feel (after some practice), that
autorotation is too easy, try it with a more realistic payload via the <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">payload</span>
menu.
