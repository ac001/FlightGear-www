class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear</span></a></h3>
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >History may be a boring subject. However, from time to time there are people asking for
the history of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear</span>. As a result, we&#8217;ll give a short outline.
<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   The <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>project goes back to a discussion among a group of net citizens in
1996 resulting in a proposal written by David Murr<a 
 id="dx39-229001"></a> who, unfortunately, dropped out of
the project (as well as the net) later. The original proposal<a 
 id="dx39-229002"></a> is still available from the
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>web site and can be found under
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >   <a 
href="http://www.flightgear.org/proposal-3.0.1" >http://www.flightgear.org/proposal-3.0.1</a>.
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >Although the names of the people and several of the details have changed over time, the
spirit of that proposal has clearly been retained up to the present time.
<!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   Actual coding started in the summer of 1996 and by the end of that year
essential graphics routines were completed. At that time, programming was mainly
performed and coordinated by Eric Korpela<a 
 id="dx39-229003"></a> from Berkeley University. Early code ran
under Linux<a 
 id="dx39-229004"></a> as well as under DOS<a 
 id="dx39-229005"></a>, OS/2<a 
 id="dx39-229006"></a>, Windows 95/NT<a 
 id="dx39-229007"></a>, and Sun-OS<a 
 id="dx39-229008"></a>. This
was found to be quite an ambitious project as it involved, among other things,
writing all the graphics routines<a 
 id="dx39-229009"></a> in a system-independent way entirely from
scratch.
<!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >   Development slowed and finally stopped in the beginning of 1997 when Eric was
completing his thesis. At this point, the project seemed to be dead and traffic on the
mailing list went down to nearly nothing.
<!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >   It was Curt Olson<a 
 id="dx39-229010"></a> from the University of Minnesota who re-launched the
project in the middle of 1997. His idea was as simple as it was powerful: Why
invent the wheel a second time? There have been several free flight simulators<a 
 id="dx39-229011"></a>
available running on workstation<a 
 id="dx39-229012"></a>s under different flavors of UNIX<a 
 id="dx39-229013"></a>. One of these,
LaRCsim<a 
 id="dx39-229014"></a> (developed by Bruce Jackson<a 
 id="dx39-229015"></a> from NASA), seemed to be well suited
to the approach. Curt took this one apart and re-wrote several of the routines
such as to make them build as well as run on the intended target platforms. The
key idea in doing so was to exploit a system-independent graphics platform:
OpenGL<a 
 id="dx39-229016"></a>.
<!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >   In addition, a clever decision on the selection of the basic scenery<a 
 id="dx39-229017"></a> data was made
in the very first version. <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>scenery is created based on satellite data
published by the U. S. Geological Survey<a 
 id="dx39-229018"></a>. These terrain data are available from

href="http://edcdaac.usgs.gov/gtopo30/gtopo30.html" >http://edcdaac.usgs.gov/gtopo30/gtopo30.html</a>,
                                                                     

                                                                     
<!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" >resp., for other countries. Those freely accessible scenery data, in conjunction with
scenery building tools included with <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear</span><span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">!</span>, are an important feature enabling
anyone to create his or her own scenery.
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   This new <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>code - still largely being based on the original LaRCsim<a 
 id="dx39-229019"></a> code -
was released in July 1997. From that moment the project gained momentum again. Here
are some milestones in the more recent development history.

     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Texture  support<a 
 id="dx39-230002"></a>  was  added  by  Curt  Olson<a 
 id="dx39-230003"></a>  in  spring  1998.  This  marked
     a  significant  improvement  in  terms  of  reality.  Some  high-quality  textures<a 
 id="dx39-230004"></a>
     were submitted by Eric Mitchell<a 
 id="dx39-230005"></a> for the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>project. Another set of
     high-quality textures was added by Erik Hofman<a 
 id="dx39-230006"></a> ever since.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">After improving the scenery<a 
 id="dx39-230007"></a> and texture<a 
 id="dx39-230008"></a> support frame rate<a 
 id="dx39-230009"></a> dropped down to
     a point where <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear </span>became unflyable in spring 1998. This issue was
     resolved by exploiting hardware OpenGL<a 
 id="dx39-230010"></a> support, which became available
     at that time, and implementing view frustrum culling<a 
 id="dx39-230011"></a> (a rendering technique
     that  ignores  the  part  of  the  scenery  not  visible  in  a  scene),  done  by
     Curt  Olson<a 
 id="dx39-230012"></a>.  With  respect  to  frame  rate<a 
 id="dx39-230013"></a>  one  should  keep  in  mind  that  the
     code,  at  present,  is  in  no  way  optimized,  which  leaves  room  for  further
     improvements.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">In  September  1998  Curt  Olson<a 
 id="dx39-230014"></a>  succeeded  in  creating  a  complete  terrain
     model for the U.S. The scenery is available worldwide now, via a clickable
     map <a

     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Scenery<a 
 id="dx39-230016"></a>  was  further  improved  by  adding  geographic  features<a 
 id="dx39-230017"></a>  including
     lakes, rivers,and coastlines later, an effort still going on. Textured runways
     were added by Dave Cornish<a 
 id="dx39-230018"></a> in spring 2001. Light textures<a 
 id="dx39-230019"></a> add to the visual
     impression  at  night.  To  cope  with  the  constant  growth  of  scenery  data,  a
     binary scenery format was introduced in spring 2001. Runway lighting<a 
 id="dx39-230020"></a> was
     introduced by Curt Olson<a 
 id="dx39-230021"></a> in spring 2001. Finally, a completely new set of
     scenery<a 
 id="dx39-230022"></a> files for the whole world was created by William Riley<a 
 id="dx39-230023"></a> based on
     preparatory documentation by David Megginson<a 
 id="dx39-230024"></a> in summer 2002. This is
                                                                     

                                                                     
     based on a data set called VMap0<a 
 id="dx39-230025"></a> as an alternative to the GSHHS data<a 
 id="dx39-230026"></a> used
     so far. This scenery is a big improvement as it has world wide coverage of
     main streets, rivers, etc., while it&#8217;s downside are much less accurate coast
     lines. <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">FlightGear</span>&#8217;s base scenery is based on these new scenery files since
     summer 2002.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">There was support added for static objects<a 
 id="dx39-230027"></a> to the scenery in 2001, which
     permits  placing  buildings,  static  planes,  trees  and  so  on  in  the  scenery.
     However,  despite  a  few  proofs  of  concept  systematic  inclusion  of  these
     landmarks is still missing.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The world is populated with random ground objects<a 
 id="dx39-230028"></a> with appropriate type
     and  density  for  the  local  ground  cover  type  since  summer  2002.  This
     marks a mayor improvement of reality and is mainly thanks to work by D.
     Megginson<a

     <li class="itemize">A HUD<a 
 id="dx39-231002"></a> (head up display<a

     America<a 
 id="dx39-231004"></a> and Charlie Hotchkiss<a 
 id="dx39-231005"></a> in the fall of 1997 and was improved later by
     Norman Vine. While not generally available for real Cessna 172<a 
 id="dx39-231006"></a>, the HUD
     conveniently reports the actual flight performance of the simulation and may
     be of further use in military jets later.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">A rudimentary autopilot<a 
 id="dx39-231007"></a> implementing heading hold was contributed by Jeff
     Goeke-Smith<a 
 id="dx39-231008"></a> in April 1998. It was improved by the addition of an altitude
     hold and a terrain following switch in October 1998 and further developed
     by Norman Vine<a 
 id="dx39-231009"></a> later.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Friedemann  Reinhard  <a 
 id="dx39-231010"></a>developed  early  instrument  panel<a 
 id="dx39-231011"></a>  code,  which  was
     added in June 1998. Unfortunately, development of that panel slowed down
     later.  Finally,  David  Megginson  <a 
 id="dx39-231012"></a>decided  to  rebuild  the  panel  code  from
     scratch in January 2000. This led to a rapid addition of new instruments and
     features to the panel, resulting in nearly all main instruments being included
     until spring 2001. A handy minipanel was added in summer 2001.

     <li class="itemize">Finally,  LaRCsim<a 
 id="dx39-231013"></a>s  Navion<a 
 id="dx39-231014"></a>  was  replaced  as  the  default  aircraft  when  the
     Cessna 172<a 
 id="dx39-231015"></a> was stable enough in February 2000 - as move most users will
     welcome. There are now several flight model<a 
 id="dx39-231016"></a> and airplane options to choose
     from at runtime. Jon Berndt<a 
 id="dx39-231017"></a> has invested a lot of time in a more realistic and
     versatile flight model with a more powerful aircraft configuration method.
     <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">JSBSim</span>, as it has come to be called, did replace LaRCsim as the default flight
     dynamics model<a 
 id="dx39-231018"></a> (FDM<a 
 id="dx39-231019"></a>), and it is planned to include such features as fuel
     slosh effects, turbulence, complete flight control systems, and other features
     not often found all together in a flight simulator. As an alternative, Andy
     Ross<a 
 id="dx39-231020"></a> added another flight dynamics model called <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">YASim </span>(Yet Another Flight
     Dynamics Simulator) which aims at simplicity of use and is based on fluid
     dynamics, by the end of 2001. This one bought us flight models for a 747, an
     A4, and a DC-3. Alternatively, a group around Michael Selig<a 
 id="dx39-231021"></a> from the UIUC<a 
 id="dx39-231022"></a>
     group provided another flight model along with several planes since around
     2000.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">A fully operational radio stack<a 
 id="dx39-231023"></a> and working radios were added to the panel
     by  Curt  Olson<a 
 id="dx39-231024"></a>  in  spring  2000.  A  huge  database  of  Navaids  contributed
     by  Robin  Peel<a 
 id="dx39-231025"></a>  allows  IFR  navigation  since  then.  There  was  basic  ATC<a 
 id="dx39-231026"></a>
     support added in fall 2001 by David Luff<a 
 id="dx39-231027"></a>. This is not yet fully implemented,
     but displaying ATIS messages<a 
 id="dx39-231028"></a> is already possible. A magneto switch<a 
 id="dx39-231029"></a> with
     proper functions was added at the end of 2001 by John Check<a 
 id="dx39-231030"></a> and David
     Megginson.<a 
 id="dx39-231031"></a>.  Moreover,  several  panels  were  continually  improved  during
     2001  and  2002  by  John  and  others.  <span

 id="dx39-233018"></a>
     developed by Curt Olson<a 
 id="dx39-233019"></a> late in 2001 can now act a property manager<a 
 id="dx39-233020"></a> for
     external programs.

     <li class="itemize">Manually changing views<a 
 id="dx39-233021"></a> in a flight simulator is in a sense always &#8220;unreal&#8221;
     but  nonetheless  required  in  certain  situations.  A  possible  solution  was
     supplied by Norman Vine<a 
 id="dx39-233022"></a> in the winter of 1999 by implementing code for
     changing views using the mouse. Alternatively, you can use a hat switch for
     this purpose, today.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">A   property   manager<a 
 id="dx39-233023"></a>   was   implemented   by   David   Megginson<a 
 id="dx39-233024"></a>   in   fall
     2000.  It  allows  parsing  a  file  called  <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">.fgfsrc</span><a 
 id="dx39-233025"></a> under  UNIX/Linux  and
     <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">system.fgfsrc</span><a 
 id="dx39-233026"></a> under Windows for input options. This plain ASCII file
     has proven useful in submitting the growing number of input options, and
     notably  the  joystick  settings<a 
 id="dx39-233027"></a>.  This  has  shown  to  be  a  useful  concept,  and
     joystick, keyboard, and panel settings are no longer hard coded but set using
     *.xml files since spring 2001 thanks to work mainly by David Megginson
     and John Check.<a

first direction is adding airport<a 
 id="dx39-235001"></a>s, buildings, and more of those things bringing scenery to
real life and belonging to realistic airports and cities. Another task is further
implementation of the menu system<a 
 id="dx39-235002"></a>, which should not be too hard with the basics being
working now. A lot of options at present set via command line or even during compile
time should finally make it into menu entries. Finally, <span
