Curt,

I've decided to get you into the "group" so to speak, and included is the
Wish List in draft form as it stands right now.  Keep in mind it is based
on the Table of Contents from the Flight Assignment ATP handbook, with
additions and sections added.  Please add, and comment wherever you feel it
is necessary, just make sure you put in your initials and the date. I am
also sending ATPCAT, a text document containing all the major categories
that I could think of. 

Updating of the categories and master wish list could be done one of two
ways:

1) If you want to add to the category list, do so...and add the numbered
category name at the bottom of the list and send it to me :)  This list
should make adding to the main wish list easier...here's how.  Instead of
sending the whole list, you just email the bits that you want to add or
change with the major category and number along with it. In this manner, I
will be able to update the list and send everyone weekly editions (unless
additions to the list are very good and need to be shared more quickly)  

2) I could give everyone in the core team, everyone else's email addresses
and then you can CC any changes to the group.  That way everyone will have
a "master copy" to which they can cut-and-paste the additional material to.

If anyone has a better idea, please let me know...I am all ears :) 

I will be converting the current wish list to an easier-to-read arrangment
as well.  This will be done to make it easier to add to the wish list.


Does anyone have a preference for Word docs, or is a TXT file ok?  I
suspect after awhile I will start a Forum-based wish list, and distribute
that as well.

Thanks for your time,

Michael Smith

Content-Description: Atp2 (Text Document)
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="ATP2.txt"

This outline/rough draft is based on the table of contents from the ATP =
manual.
If you add something..put your initials and the date in ()

any questions/comments should be directed to Michael =
Smith...msmith99@flash.net

Make sure "Word Wrap" option is enabled to format this document =
correctly.


Here goes:

1) Running ATP
	System requirements
	(MS 12/17)  A minimum and optimal system configuration is needed.  =
Seems like everyone upgraded to P166 or higher for the most recent =
flight sim releases, so maybe those system configurations could be used =
as a baseline.

X) Gameplay Aspects (added 12/18 MS)
	1) provide realistic, immersive airline simulation
		Detail =3D Immersion. (see comments further below)
	2) simulate a "national" environment
		maybe ATP2 should have a "campaign" engine, similiar to the WARGEN =
system of EF2000 without the bombers :)
		This "Campaign" would operate in the same manner as the national =
flight watch system (or whatever it's =09
		called) in Washington DC.  This way, when I go to fly, my departure =
time slot is already determined, and it's
		up to me (the PIC) to ensure a timely departure, safe flight, and =
landing.  Also, by its very nature the
		campaign "manages" all the other a/c in the skies.  The AI of each a/c =
would be tied into this national
		campaign, so any ripple effects would be realistic (ie.  Blizzard at =
JFK, holds a/c up at CLE and ORD)
		On a weather note, this FLIGHTGEN system would also manage weather =
from coast to coast as it changes (like
		in real life)  I think it would be prudent to include some way to link =
with realtime WX from the Internet
		as well.  Gone are the days of ATP, where you could fly over the =
singular, ever-present polygon cloud :)
	3) realistic ATC
	4) realistic AI for everything from baggage carts to B747's


2) The 3D Window and Instrument Panels
	Two words:  Photorealistic Panels....nuf said.
	(MS 12/16) Two more words: Fully Functioning  (ie no dead buttons)
	With a good 3D virtual cockpit ATP2 could have a unique traffic scan =
key, where the view switches to VC, and scans from left to right, then =
returns to center.
	(MS 12/16) Why not have a view dedicated to the task of taxiing?  One =
big problem with FS and heavies are the BIG panels...ATP2 should have a =
way to toggle a "taxi-cam" view over the IP.
	(MS 12/18) ATP2 could have a virtual cockpit along the same lines as =
EF2000...where hotkeys "zoom" in an certain areas of the IP.  This might =
be a better solution (?) than the ubiquitous <TAB> key.  I think it =
would be cool to see a nice 3-D modelled cockpit instead of the same old =
flat panel display.  Maybe the cockpit could have hotkey selectable =
modes like... Preflight (almost all panel, little outside display gives =
better access to switches and gauges, Taxi (smaller panel, higher =
viewpoint for better viewing of taxiway signs), takeoff (3-D cockpit =
with important gauges functioning (or displayed larger) and better =
peripheral vision than standard 2-D viewpoint) and cruise (3-D cockpit, =
and give the pilot the ability to "pull" gauges and readouts off and =
make them larger)

X) The Outside View (added)
	I think it goes without saying that ATP2 should have butt-loads of =
other a/c around...all communicating with ATC and following =
instructions.  Having said that, I think a/c not immediately in visual =
range could be rendered (indicated) as navigation and anti-collision =
lights.  Then when the a/c is close enought to be in visual range, a =
visual model would be displayed.  This is like, but better than the =
effect in X-plane...and more like the effect used in Tower.
	I think the illusion of a busy "world" is necessary in the terminal and =
approach phase of flight.  This is not only with a/c but with scenery =
around the airport.  As an a/c descends through a certain altitude, =
roads should be rendered in scale widths, with appropriate lighting =
(depending on TOD)  I think indication of road traffic could be easy, =
and would totally immerse the pilot.  Car traffic could be indicated =
easily with red and white lights.  Imagine flying the app to 27L at ORD, =
following the road into O'Hare and seeing red taillights on the right =
side of the highway and white headlights on the left.  The illusion =
would be further helped by dimming the lights for distance effects, and =
possibly "clumping" groups of traffic together/ or making it look =
random.  The other situation where I could see the value of this =
immersion technique would be on the approach to 23 at ERI, where as you =
cross the approach lighting on final, you pass directly over a =
road...here you could have traffic passing underneath your flight path, =
with two "cones" of light (representing the headlight beams) displayed =
on the road in front of the car.
	(MS 12/16)  Landing lights should work everywhere...clouds, taxiways, =
runways, fields, streams..you name it.  In FS, the effect is more =
surprising than usefull when your landing lights suddenly illuminate the =
runway on final app.

3) Menu Descriptions

4) Aircraft Controls and Systems

X) At The Airport (added)
	(MS 12/18) Two words...Yugoslavia Scenery  (credit to Bob, I downloaded =
this freeware scenery and fell right out of my chair...it's that good, =
and rightfully represents the MINIMUM level of realism for a proper =
airline sim.
	Airports should have lots of static a/c and moving ground traffic...at =
levels appropriate to the size and congestion level of the airport.  =
O'Hare should look busy like ORD, and SAN should feel like San Diego.  =
The illusion of a "busy" airport should be complete...I want to see =
catering vehicles, fueling traffic, baggage trains, etc.  Distant ground =
traffic could be simply rendered with moving flashing yellow lights, to =
simulate vehicles moving about the tarmac.  In this case indication =
would suffice.
	Airports should have gates modelled extremely accurately.  I want to =
see the gate swing away before pushback... and wing walkers out the =
windows.
	Airports should have de-icing facilities... with 3D effects ATP2 could =
simulate the process of de-icing by having trucks pull up beside, and =
"wash/de-ice" the a/c with a nice fog/mist effect.
	ATP2 should be very detailed in the area of pre-flight.
		Walk-arounds
		Checklists
		Maintenance issues
			(why not have a "briefing" from the Flight Line mechanic discussing =
any maintenance issues...giving the pilot the responsibility to "make =
the call" to delay for maint. or go w/o it.)
		Weights and balance
		Fuel load
			(make it so you have to request the fuel load, and then you receive a =
fueling card from the line personal...like in real life)
		Late passengers
			(affects your departure time, loose your slot in the departure =
window)

5) View Controls
	People will always want to see their a/c from the outside...so a =
rotating, pan and zoom camera must be included...with the ability to =
take screen snapshots. (MS 12/16) have a more unique name for it than =
"external cam"...maybe something like "Glory Shot" or "Promo Cam" or =
"Advertisement Cam"  :)
	Views from the pilot's seat should be done in the same manner as PP, =
the only enhancement desired being the ability to see passengers in the =
passenger cabin (full flight, full cabin...empty flight, empty cabin) =20
	Maybe a special view would be needed (and another switch on the IP) to =
check for icing on the leading edges of the wings.

6) Flight Physics and Aircraft Control
=09
7) a Flight Lesson

	Lessons could be performed as "charter flights", where the pilot can =
choose a departure and destination, and type of a/c suited to the lesson =
plan.

8) Simulation Controls
	(MS 12/16) Yokes, and force feedback must be supported.


9) Flight Modes Menu

10) Mode Library Menu

11) Environment Menu
      Weather Effects Desired:
	1) Adjustable visibility
		(MS 12/18) maybe quick keys for CAT I, II, and III, and IFR minimum =
conditions
	2) Fog
		(MS 12/18) a distinction needs to be made between FOG and HAZE...I =
think a sim should be able to model both conditions.  There is a =
difference in color (and other aspects) between haze on a hot summer =
day, and fog on a cold winter morning.  Since the ideal sim should be =
able to track WX changes, it should be able to "burn off" a morning fog, =
for example, as the temperatures increase.

	3) Fractal visibilty (not diameter based visibility)
	4) Frontal weather systems
	5) National weather
	6) Rain
	7) Snow
	8) Icing
	9) Clouds (BIG, BEAUTIFUL 3-D CLOUDS)
	10) Turbulence
	11) Storms and Squalls, Lightning and Thunder

      The WX should be appropriate for the:
	1) Season
	2) Time of day
	3) Area of the country

	The sky should change color as you climb higher...no more same pale =
blue color at 4k and 40k.

	(MS 12/16) to remain competitive..ATP2 should have gradient ground =
palletes that "Grey" out as you go higher.

12) Graphics Menu
	The baseline auto-complexity idea of ATP should be taken to the extreme =
in ATP2.  The gate and airport should be the most graphically rich =
environment...decreasing slightly in the surrounding area, decreasing =
still in the terminal area, decreasing still in the APP/DEP segment, and =
ending in the least graphically intensive cruise segment.

13) Aircraft Menu

If we limit the number of a/c to five, ATP2 would fall very short of its =
potential...

(MS 12/16)  HERE is a counterpoint to that:  If ATP2 had fewer a/c that =
it simulated to a higher degree of realism that would be acceptable... =
maybe one commuter and two heavier a/c...say Do-328, B737, and B767?  =
Dunno.

Here are two preliminary lists of a/c near and dear to my heart that I =
think represent a good cross section for their respective a/c type:

The Commuter class a/c:
	1) Fairchild Metro
	2) Saab340
	3) ATR42  (maybe Jetstream41?)
	4) Dornier 328
	5) BAE 146
The Heavies:
	1) MD-80
	2) B737-400
	3) A320
	4) B757 (A330, or B767)
	5) A340 (B747-400)

The choice of a/c should be logical according to airport, range, # of =
pax.

"THE HANGAR OF YOUR DREAMS"   <of course these should be appropriate to =
an airline sim..no Piper Cubs now :) >

14) Flight Planning Menu
	(MS 12/16)  Support for RNAV, GPS, FMS must be fully functional. Did I =
miss any?

15) Status Report and Help Menus
	(MS 12/16)  ATP2 should simulate (and allow the pilot to use) more =
systems of the a/c... de-ice, anti-fire systems, APU, etc.  ATP was =
great to the extent it went with being able to adjust MAX Gross weight =
and fuel and passenger loading..but it needs to go further.

16) Virtual Airlines
	Online Virtual Airlines (added)
		I think ATP2 should cater to the specific needs of VA's. To that =
end...was thinking about allowing the user to insert custom tailart =
(from their VA) and give them the ability to set the color (and maybe =
general graphic break up) of the fuselage.  Also they should be able to =
add the text name of their VA onto the a/c.

	Career Flight Assignment=20

	(MS 12/16)  ATP2 could have a fundamentally altered gameplay aspect... =
It would reflect more accurately the job of an ATP.  Here is a sketchy =
description of how I see the sim unfolding in career mode:
	Pilot Mike is still flying the commuters, but at the end of his next =
flight he'll have enough hours to take a check ride to move up to the =
"heavies".  Pilot Mike accepts his next Flight Assignment and screen =
fades to... the interior of a nicely 3-d modelled concourse...the =
airport name and location conveniently displayed on a "welcome to blah =
blah airport"  background noise consists of people talking, a/c =
operating outside...and also flight blah blah to blah blah now boarding =
<strange..that is pilot mike's flight :) > ...screen fades to exterior =
shot of Pilot Mike's Do-328, and an animated Pilot Mike does his =
pre-flight walkaround as a checklist appears on the screen and check's =
each item off the list as Pilot Mike makes his circuit around the a/c.  =
...fade to a dark (no power on) cockpit where Pilot Mike is briefed by =
the line mechanic, and given a fuel card (which he must verify as having =
the correct amount of fuel requested). In the background, a flight =
attendant announces passenger boarding, while Pilot Mike starts going =
through checklists and powers up the a/c  <the sim must have noises for =
many things at this point, an APU startup...switches being =
toggled...challenges and responses from the right seat =
pilot...passengers boarding.  Engine startup sequence noises, and door =
shutting and being locked... the cabin briefing and some nonsense about =
"prepare for cross-check"...if pilot Mike wasn't so busy getting the =
number two engine to start, he might see that this flight is not =
overbooked as not all the seats are filled.  By this time, communication =
has started with C/D and ground in preparation for taxi... <forgive me, =
I get really excited thinking about this kind of stuff>

The main point being that gameplay is all about immersion, give me =
noises and indications that what I am doing is important, being able to =
see and hear passengers/co-pilot/flight attendants is a key =
point...otherwise it's just a flight sim.  That soft "bong" noise when =
the seatbelt light is on..I WANT TO HEAR THAT...heck, I want the switch =
that turns em on :)  When ATC has to divert me out, or has me hold =
somewhere...I want to hear passengers grumbling behind me when I =
announce "we will be a little late getting in to Cleveland"  better yet, =
I want to have the grumbling drowned out by thunder from the level 5 =
storm cell ATC just vectored us around  :)

Ideas from Bob Smith 12/16/97:

The concept of the sim as a product.

What makes it different/better than other sims?

Has to interface with SB/PC.
	have the ability to "switch" internal ATC off for "online" flying.

Coding up AI rules for where:
Fuel trucks, baggage carts go...
ORD has parameters (#flights, #passengers, number of baggage carts, =
#cars in parking lot)
AI responds to the parameters of each airport
Here is the movement area, here's where the taxiways are.
Trucks drive and react to a/c in the movement area, and other vehicles.

Yugoslavia scenery   <must see>
as baseline

Charter Flight (instead of "Single Flight Assignment"
	no rating necessary
	still must adhere to ATC instructions
	can be used as lessons
Career Flight

Contact Jim Kohan (about ideas concerning VA's)

config file for Va's
route table listed in that .CFG file
with turnaround times
and timetables

fly GLE
give pilot #
give DEP city
looks up hubs and dep cities
looks up flights
shows route and time tables
have to meet specific times for the "legs"
if 15min late...maybe turnaround is shorter time.

Should ATP2 be more commuter oriented?
	from concerns about #of airports needed depending on type of a/c in the =
sim. ie Commuter type a/c would yield more airports, whereas heavier =
jets need the BIG fields exclusively.
Lotsa airports compared to number of airports required for "Heavies"
maybe East/West scenery blocks?

What about open architecture?

Comment from Mark Stewart about "photorealistic panels" referred to a =
review of Elite panels at FlightSim.com, panels were stunning to say the =
least.
