<H1>The Aberystwyth Lighter Than Air Intelligent Robot (ALTAIR)</H1>
<H3>University of Wales, Aberystwyth</H3>

<P>

For those planets and moons that support an atmosphere 
(e.g. Mars, Venus, Titan and Jupiter), flying robots, or
aerobots, are likely to provide a practical solution to
the problem of extended planetary surface coverage for
terrain mapping and surface/subsurface composition surveying.
Not only could such devices be used for suborbital mapping of 
terrain regions, but they could be used to transport and 
deploy science packages or even microrovers at different
geographically separate landing sites.
<P>

Much attention has been given to the use of planetary rovers for
exploration, but whilst they are clearly competent at facilitating
useful science, their application is terrain limited. Aerobots,
in comparison, have no such limitations.
<P>

The technological challenges posed by planetary aerobots are
significant, and members of the Intelligent Robotics Group at
the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, UK, are investigating
the design and control of aerobots that can fly autonomously to
designated landing sites. To investigate this problem we are
building a virtual environment to simulate autonomous aerobot
flight. Our simulator uses the FlightGear software system and
incorporates 'realistic' meteorological conditions and Martian
terrain. 
<P>

We are using the NaSt3DGP computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
software package to generate meteorological conditions.
The meteorological data is 'loaded' into the FlightGear simulator to
create realistic wind effects acting upon an aerobot when flying over
a given terrain. The terrain model used by both FlightGear and 
NaSt3DGP is obtained from the MGS Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA)
instrument, and the Mars Climate Database (MCD) is used to initialise
the CFD simulation.
