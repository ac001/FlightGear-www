This is kind of neat.  Zoom in on the cockpit from an external view and
you can see a fully working, live instrument panel through the canopy.
This is the same exact instrument panel you see when you are inside the
cockpit.  No illusions or tricks here, just a fully working 3d animated
cockpit visible from inside or out.
