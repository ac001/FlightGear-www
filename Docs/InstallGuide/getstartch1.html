<!--l. 37--><P CLASS="noindent">Did you ever want to fly a plane yourself, but lacked the money or ability to
do so? Are you a real pilot looking to improve your skills without having to
take off? Do you want to try some dangerous maneuvers without risking your
life? Or do you just want to have fun with a more serious game without any
violence? If any of these questions apply to you, PC flight simulators are just for
you.
<!--l. 43--><P CLASS="indent">   You may already have some experience using Microsoft<A 
  NAME="dx5-5001"></A>&#8217;s &copy; Flight Simulator or any
other of the commercially available PC flight simulators. As the price tag of those is
                                                                     

                                                                     
usually within the $50 range, buying one of them should not be a serious problem given
that running any serious PC flight simulator requires PC hardware within the $1500
range, despite dropping prices.
<!--l. 49--><P CLASS="indent">   With so many commercially available flight simulators, why would we spend
thousands of hours of programming and design work to build a free flight simulator?
Well, there are many reasons, but here are the major ones:
     <UL CLASS="itemize1">
     <LI CLASS="itemize">All of the commercial simulators have a serious drawback: they are made
     by a small group of developers defining their properties according to what
     is important to them and providing limited interfaces to end users. Anyone
     who  has  ever  tried  to  contact  a  commercial  developer  would  agree  that
     getting your voice heard in that environment is a major challenge. In contrast,
     <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </SPAN>is designed by the people and for the people with everything out
     in the open.
     </LI>
     <LI CLASS="itemize">Commercial simulators are usually a compromise of features and usability.
     Most commercial developers want to be able to serve a broad segment of
     the population, including serious pilots, beginners, and even casual gamers.
     In reality the result is always a compromise due to deadlines and funding.
     As <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </SPAN>is free and open, there is no need for such a compromise.
     We have no publisher breathing down our necks, and we&#8217;re all volunteers
     that make our own deadlines. We are also at liberty to support markets that
     no commercial developer would consider viable, like the scientific research
     community.
     </LI>
     <LI CLASS="itemize">Due to their closed-source nature, commercial simulators keep developers
     with  excellent  ideas  and  skills  from  contributing  to  the  products.  With
     <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear</SPAN>, developers of all skill levels and ideas have the potential to make
     a huge impact on the project. Contributing to a project as large and complex
     as <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </SPAN>is very rewarding and provides the developers with a great
     deal of pride in knowing that we are shaping the future of a great simulator.
     </LI>
     <LI CLASS="itemize">Beyond everything else, it&#8217;s just plain fun! I suppose you could compare us
     to real pilots that build kit-planes or scratch-builts. Sure, we can go out a
     buy a pre-built aircraft, but there&#8217;s just something special about building one
     yourself.</LI></UL>
<!--l. 83--><P CLASS="noindent">The points mentioned above form the basis of why we created <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear</SPAN>. With those
                                                                     

                                                                     
motivations in mind, we have set out to create a high-quality flight simulator that aims to
be a civilian,<A

  NAME="dx5-5003"></A> open,<A 
  NAME="dx5-5004"></A> user-supported,<A 
  NAME="dx5-5005"></A> and user-extensible<A 
  NAME="dx5-5006"></A> platform. Let us
take a closer look at each of these characteristics:
     <UL CLASS="itemize1">
     <LI CLASS="itemize"><SPAN 
CLASS="ptmb7t---109">Civilian:</SPAN><A 
  NAME="dx5-5007"></A>  The  project  is  primarily  aimed  at  civilian  flight  simulation.  It
     should  be  appropriate  for  simulating  general  aviation  as  well  as  civilian
     aircraft. Our long-term goal is to have <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </SPAN>FAA-approved as a flight
     training  device.  To  the  disappointment  of  some  users,  it  is  currently  not
     a  combat  simulator;  however,  these  features  are  not  explicitly  excluded.
     We just have not had a developer that was seriously interested in systems
     necessary for combat simulation.
     </LI>
     <LI CLASS="itemize"><SPAN 
CLASS="ptmb7t---109">Multi-platform:</SPAN><A 
  NAME="dx5-5008"></A> The developers are attempting to keep the code as
     platform-independent as possible. This is based on their observation that people
     interested in flight simulations run quite a variety of computer hardware and
     operating systems. The present code supports the following Operating
     Systems<A

CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear</SPAN>
are not extravagant. A decent PIII/800, or something in that range, should be
sufficient given you have a proper 3-D graphics card<A

CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </SPAN>as
well.
<!--l. 177--><P CLASS="indent">   One important prerequisite for running <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </SPAN>is a graphics card whose driver
supports OpenGL<A 
  NAME="dx5-6006"></A>. If you don&#8217;t know what OpenGL<A

<!--l. 184--><P CLASS="noindent">says it best: &#8220;Since its introduction in 1992, OpenGL has become the industry&#8217;s most
widely used and supported 2-D and 3-D graphics application programming interface

<!--l. 189--><P CLASS="indent">   <SPAN

not supporting hardware accelerated OpenGL<A

3-D graphics hardware at all. However, the absence of hardware accelerated
OpenGL support can bring even the fastest machine to its knees. The typical
signal for missing hardware acceleration are frame rate<A 
  NAME="dx5-6010"></A>s below 1 frame per
second.
<!--l. 198--><P CLASS="indent">   Any modern 3-D graphics featuring OpenGL<A

card drivers that support OpenGL, visit the home page of your video card manufacturer.
You should note that sometimes OpenGL drivers<A

the graphics chip instead of by the makers of the board. If you are going to buy a
graphics card for running <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear</SPAN>, one based on a NVIDIA chip (TNT X/Geforce X)
might be a good choice.
<!--l. 205--><P CLASS="indent">   To install the executable and basic scenery, you will need around 50 MB of free disk
space<A 
  NAME="dx5-6014"></A>. In case you want/have to to compile the program yourself you will need about an
additional 500 MB for the source code and for temporary files created during
compilation. This does not include the development environment, which will vary in size
depending on the operating system and environment being used. Windows users can
expect to need approximately 300 MB of additional disk space for the development
environment. Linux and other UNIX machines should have most of the development
tools already installed, so there is likely to be little additional space needed on those
platforms.

become the next stable release with a version number calculated by adding

<!--l. 302--><P CLASS="noindent">Historically, <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </SPAN>has been based on a flight model it inherited (together with the
Navion airplane) from LaRCsim. As this had several limitations (most important,
many characteristics were hard wired in contrast to using configuration files),
there were several attempts to develop or include alternative flight models<A 
  NAME="dx5-8003"></A>. As a
result, <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </SPAN>supports several different flight models, to be chosen from at
runtime.
<!--l. 308--><P CLASS="indent">   The most important one is the JSB flight model developed by Jon Berndt. Actually,
the JSB flight model is part of a stand-alone project called <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">JSBSim</SPAN>, having its home at
<!--l. 312--><P CLASS="indent">   <A 
HREF="http://jsbsim.sourceforge.net/" >http://jsbsim.sourceforge.net/</A>.
<!--l. 315--><P CLASS="noindent">Concerning airplanes, the JSB flight model at present provides support for a Cessna 172<A 
  NAME="dx5-8004"></A>,
a Cessna 182<A 
  NAME="dx5-8005"></A>, a Cessna 310<A 
  NAME="dx5-8006"></A>, and for an experimental plane called X15<A 
  NAME="dx5-8007"></A>. Jon and his group
are gearing towards a very accurate flight model, and the JSB model has become
<SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear</SPAN>&#8217;s default flight model.
<!--l. 321--><P CLASS="indent">   As an interesting alternative, Christian Mayer developed a flight model of a hot air
balloon. Moreover, Curt Olson integrated a special &#8221;UFO&#8221; slew mode, which helps you
to quickly fly from point A to point B.
<!--l. 325--><P CLASS="indent">   Recently, Andrew Ross contributed another flight model called <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">YASim</SPAN><A 
  NAME="dx5-8008"></A> for <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmri7t---109">Yet</SPAN>
<SPAN 
CLASS="ptmri7t---109">Another Simulator</SPAN>. At present, it sports another Cessna 172<A 
  NAME="dx5-8009"></A>, a Turbo 310<A 
  NAME="dx5-8010"></A>, a fairly good
DC-3<A 
  NAME="dx5-8011"></A> model, along with a Boeing 747<A 
  NAME="dx5-8012"></A>, Harrier<A 
  NAME="dx5-8013"></A>, and A4<A 
  NAME="dx5-8014"></A>. <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">YASim </SPAN>takes a fundamentally
different approach since it&#8217;s based on geometry information rather than aerodynamic
coefficients. Where <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">JSBSim </SPAN>will be exact for every situation that is known and flight
tested, but may have odd and/or unrealistic behavior outside normal flight, <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">YASim </SPAN>will be
sensible and consistent in almost every flight situation, but is likely to differ in
performance numbers.
<!--l. 331--><P CLASS="indent">   As a further alternative, there is the UIUC flight model<A 
  NAME="dx5-8015"></A>, developed by a team at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This work was initially geared toward
modeling aircraft in icing conditions<A 
  NAME="dx5-8016"></A> together with a smart icing system to better enable
pilots to fly safely in an icing encounter. While this research continues, the
project has expanded to include modeling &#8221;nonlinear&#8221; aerodynamics, which
result in more realism in extreme attitudes, such as stall and high angle of attack
flight. Two good examples that illustrate this capability are the Airwave Xtreme
                                                                     

                                                                     
150<A 
  NAME="dx5-8017"></A> hang glider<A 
  NAME="dx5-8018"></A> and the 1903 Wright Flyer<A 
  NAME="dx5-8019"></A>. For the hang glider, throttle can
be use to fly to gliding altitude or Ctrl-U can be used to jump up in 1000-ft
increments. Try your hand at the unstable Wright Flyer and don&#8217;t stall the canard!
Considerable up elevator trim will be required for level flight. In general, the
aerodynamics are probably very close to the original Wright Flyer as they are
partly based on experimental data taken on a replica tested recently at the NASA
Ames Research Center. Also included are two more models, a Beech 99<A 
  NAME="dx5-8020"></A> and
Marchetti S-211<A 
  NAME="dx5-8021"></A> jet trainer, which are older generation UIUC/FGFS models
and based on simpler &#8221;linear&#8221; aerodynamics. More details of the UIUC flight
model and a list of aircraft soon to be upgraded can be found on their website at
