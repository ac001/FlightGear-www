UKUUG Linux Technical Conference</A>.  Leeds, England.</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Linux 2004</B>
<P>
A wide cross-section of the Linux community will gather in Leeds
this August for the annual UKUUG Linux Technical Conference.
It's a great way to broaden your knowledge and keep up-to-date
with what's happening in the world of linux.
This low-cost event is for anyone with a serious interest in linux
including systems administrators, linux professionals, developers and
enthusiasts from companies and linux user groups throughout the UK and
beyond.
<P>

The conference starts around 9.45am on Friday, 6th August,
continues with a full day of presentations on Saturday, 7th August,
and finishes about 4.30 p.m. on Sunday, 8th August.
Tutorials will be held on Thursday, 5th August.
<P>

Building upon previous years' events,
this promises to be a very successful conference.
There should be plenty of time for informal discussions.
There will be table-top displays on Friday and Saturday, and,
new this year, a keysigning session.
Places are limited, so early booking is advised.
Please recommend the event to your friends and colleagues
and download our Conference booklet (PDF). 
<P>

<B>The FlightGear Flight Simulator</B>
<P>

FlightGear is a superb open source flight simulation project,
offering the pilot's view of the cockpit and of the 3D scenery.
The simulator pilot uses joystick, keyboard, yoke, pedals and other
input devices to fly any of dozens of realistic aircraft around the
world.
<P>

In order to run well on a commodity computer system, XML files
determine which software modules are to be used and configure each so
they integrate as the desired simulation.  Individual files for
aircraft, engines, instruments and other common components enables the
simulation to reuse these files much like aircraft manufacturers reuse
engines and instruments.
<P>

Connections between software modules are resolved to objects
using a hierarchical namespace that is common to code and XML.
The same namespace is exposed as a network service,
enabling external software to monitor and modify the simulator state.
<P>

This talk introduces the scientific and engineering challenges
and presents some work currently in progress.
