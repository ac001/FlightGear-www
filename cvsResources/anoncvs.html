<H1>FGFS Anonymous CVS instructions</H1>

Here's how to access the Flight Gear anonymous (read only) cvs
repository.  You will not be able to commit changes, but you will be
able to keep your local source code tree absolutely up to date with
the master repository.
<P>

<HR>

<H3>Getting CVS</H3>

You must have a recent version of cvs installed on your system in
order for any of this to work.  <A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/">Cyclic
Software</A> supports and maintains CVS.  CVS continues to be a free,
open-source product.  Cyclic makes a living by selling support.
<P>

<HR>

<H3>Checking Out a Copy of the source code</H3>

The Flight Gear source code comes in a large tree of subdirectories.
However, you should now be able to check out the entire tree with one
"co" command.
<P>

First, cd to where ever you want the top level source directory to
live.  The top level "FlightGear" source directory will be created
here.
<P>

<STRONG>Stable Branch:</STRONG>
This is the "stable branch".  The goal is stability.  We will fix bugs
here, but not much else.

<UL>
<PRE>
    cvs -d :pserver:cvsguest@cvs.simgear.org:/var/cvs/FlightGear-0.8 login
    CVS passwd: guest

    cvs -d :pserver:cvsguest@cvs.simgear.org:/var/cvs/FlightGear-0.8 co FlightGear
</PRE>
</UL>

<P>

<STRONG>Development Branch:</STRONG>
This is where all new development and new features go.

<UL>
<PRE>
    cvs -d :pserver:cvsguest@cvs.simgear.org:/var/cvs/FlightGear-0.9 login
    CVS passwd: guest

    cvs -d :pserver:cvsguest@cvs.simgear.org:/var/cvs/FlightGear-0.9 co FlightGear
</PRE>
</UL>
<P>

<HR>

<H3>Now that you are a Developer ...</H3>

Before you can build the executables, you need to do one thing (as 
a developer) that isn't required if you are just building a regular source
distribution.  From the top level FlightGear directory (the same one
that has "configure.in", run:
<P>

<PRE>
    ./autogen.sh
</PRE>

This runs several autoconf/automake programs to create the "configure"
script and create all the "Makefile.in" files.
<P>

If you have problems running autogen.sh, make sure you have both
automake and autoconf installed on your system and try again.

Finally, after autogen.sh has successfully completed, 
you can run ./configure; make; make install

<HR>

<H3>Keeping your local copy in sync</H3>

Finally (and this is the good part) if you cd to the toplevel FlightGear
source directory (the one that was created with the very first checkout
command) and run "cvs update -d -P", your local source tree will be 
automatically synced with the master repository.  The "-d" flag automatically
adds any new directories that have been created in the repository, and the
"-P" automatically removes any old directories that have been removed 
from the repository.
<P>

CVS is pretty smart, so if you have made local changes that don't conflict
with any changes to the master repository, cvs should be able to merge the 
changes together, even when the changes have been made to the same file.

If you have made changes that do conflict with new changes to the master 
repository, cvs will let you know, and you can go edit the file with 
conflicts and resolve them.
