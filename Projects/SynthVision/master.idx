<H3>Open Source Synthetic Vision Project</H3>

<P>

Phil Cobbin is developing an open source synthetic vision system
largely based on FlightGear.  In his spare time he is also
constructing a Van's RV-7A aircraft which is the intended recipient of
the synthetic vision system.

This project combines use of a Crossbow uNAV sensor as the AHRS with
FlightGear to create a real time synthetic vision systemm for full
scale aircraft.
<P>

By tweaking some FlightGear source codes and addition of other
software tools Phil was able to add a 3d rendering of translucent
airspace boundaries to FlightGear (such as the Las Vegas Nevada area
depicted here).
<P>

Source codes are available for download from the site including DAFIF
based software for generating translucent 3d airspace boundaries, 3d
glide slope ramps etc.  The project source codes are adaptable for use
with any GPS, AHRS, or other inertial sensors with a published
communication protocol.
