CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear</SPAN></A></H3>
<!--l. 38--><P CLASS="noindent">History may be a boring subject. However, from time to time there are people asking for
the history of <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear</SPAN>. As a result, we&#8217;ll give a short outline.
<!--l. 40--><P CLASS="indent">   The <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </SPAN>project goes back to a discussion among a group of net citizens in
1996 resulting in a proposal written by David Murr<A 
  NAME="dx14-81001"></A> who, unfortunately, dropped out of
the project (as well as the net) later. The original proposal<A 
  NAME="dx14-81002"></A> is still available from the
<SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </SPAN>web site and can be found under
<!--l. 44--><P CLASS="indent">   <A 
HREF="../../proposal-3.0.1" >http://www.flightgear.org/proposal-3.0.1</A>.
<!--l. 47--><P CLASS="noindent">Although the names of the people and several of the details have changed over time, the
spirit of that proposal has clearly been retained up to the present time.
<!--l. 51--><P CLASS="indent">   Actual coding started in the summer of 1996 and by the end of that year
essential graphics routines were completed. At that time, programming was mainly
performed and coordinated by Eric Korpela<A 
  NAME="dx14-81003"></A> from Berkeley University. Early code ran
under Linux<A 
  NAME="dx14-81004"></A> as well as under DOS<A 
  NAME="dx14-81005"></A>, OS/2<A 
  NAME="dx14-81006"></A>, Windows 95/NT<A 
  NAME="dx14-81007"></A>, and Sun-OS<A 
  NAME="dx14-81008"></A>. This
was found to be quite an ambitious project as it involved, among other things,
writing all the graphics routines<A 
  NAME="dx14-81009"></A> in a system-independent way entirely from
scratch.
<!--l. 59--><P CLASS="indent">   Development slowed and finally stopped in the beginning of 1997 when Eric was
completing his thesis. At this point, the project seemed to be dead and traffic on the
mailing list went down to nearly nothing.
<!--l. 63--><P CLASS="indent">   It was Curt Olson<A 
  NAME="dx14-81010"></A> from the University of Minnesota who re-launched the
project in the middle of 1997. His idea was as simple as it was powerful: Why
invent the wheel a second time? There have been several free flight simulators<A 
  NAME="dx14-81011"></A>
available running on workstation<A 
  NAME="dx14-81012"></A>s under different flavors of UNIX<A 
  NAME="dx14-81013"></A>. One of these,
LaRCsim<A 
  NAME="dx14-81014"></A> (developed by Bruce Jackson<A 
  NAME="dx14-81015"></A> from NASA), seemed to be well suited
to the approach. Curt took this one apart and re-wrote several of the routines
such as to make them build as well as run on the intended target platforms. The
key idea in doing so was to exploit a system-independent graphics platform:
OpenGL<A 
  NAME="dx14-81016"></A>.
<!--l. 73--><P CLASS="indent">   In addition, a clever decision on the selection of the basic scenery<A 
  NAME="dx14-81017"></A> data was made
in the very first version. <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </SPAN>scenery is created based on satellite data
published by the U. S. Geological Survey<A 
  NAME="dx14-81018"></A>. These terrain data are available from

scenery building tools included with <SPAN

anyone to create his or her own scenery.
<!--l. 95--><P CLASS="indent">   This new <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </SPAN>code - still largely being based on the original LaRCsim<A

was released in July 1997. From that moment the project gained momentum again. Here
are some milestones in the more recent development history.

     resolved by exploiting hardware OpenGL<A 
  NAME="dx14-82010"></A> support, which became available
     at that time, and implementing view frustrum culling<A 
  NAME="dx14-82011"></A> (a rendering technique
     that  ignores  the  part  of  the  scenery  not  visible  in  a  scene),  done  by

     lakes, rivers,and coastlines later, an effort still going on. Textured runways
     were added by Dave Cornish<A

     binary scenery format was introduced in spring 2001. Runway lighting<A 
  NAME="dx14-82020"></A> was
     introduced by Curt Olson<A 
  NAME="dx14-82021"></A> in spring 2001. Finally, a completely new set of
     scenery<A 
  NAME="dx14-82022"></A> files for the whole world was created by William Riley<A 
  NAME="dx14-82023"></A> based on
     preparatory documentation by David Megginson<A

     so far. This scenery is a big improvement as it has world wide coverage of
     main streets, rivers, etc., while it&#8217;s downside are much less accurate coast
     lines. <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear</SPAN>&#8217;s base scenery is based on these new scenery files since

     added in June 1998. Unfortunately, development of that panel slowed down
     later.  Finally,  David  Megginson  <A 
  NAME="dx14-83012"></A>decided  to  rebuild  the  panel  code  from
     scratch in January 2000. This led to a rapid addition of new instruments and
     features to the panel, resulting in nearly all main instruments being included
     until spring 2001. A handy minipanel was added in summer 2001.

     <LI CLASS="itemize">Finally,  LaRCsim<A 
  NAME="dx14-83013"></A>s  Navion<A

     welcome. There are now several flight model<A 
  NAME="dx14-83016"></A> and airplane options to choose
     from at runtime. Jon Berndt<A 
  NAME="dx14-83017"></A> has invested a lot of time in a more realistic and
     versatile flight model with a more powerful aircraft configuration method.
     <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">JSBSim</SPAN>, as it has come to be called, did replace LaRCsim as the default
     flight  dynamics  model<A 
  NAME="dx14-83018"></A>  (FDM<A

     as fuel slosh effects, turbulence, complete flight control systems, and other
     features not often found all together in a flight simulator. As an alternative,
     Andy Ross<A 
  NAME="dx14-83020"></A> added another flight dynamics model called <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">YASim </SPAN>(Yet Another
     Flight Dynamics Simulator) which aims at simplicity of use and is based on
     fluid dynamics, by the end of 2001. This one bought us flight models for a
     747, an A4, and a DC-3. Alternatively, a group around Michael Selig<A 
  NAME="dx14-83021"></A> from
     the  UIUC<A

  NAME="dx14-85012"></A>and Curt
     Olson<A 
  NAME="dx14-85013"></A>  starting  fall  1999.  This  effort  is  aimed  at  enabling  <SPAN

     run concurrently on several machines over a network<A 
  NAME="dx14-85014"></A>, either an Intranet or
                                                                     

                                                                     
     the Internet<A 
  NAME="dx14-85015"></A>, coupling it to a flight planner<A 
  NAME="dx14-85016"></A> running on a second machine,
     and  more.  There  emerged  several  approaches  for  remotely  controlling
     <SPAN 
CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </SPAN>over a Network during 2001. Notably there was added support
     for the &#8221;Atlas&#8221;<A 
  NAME="dx14-85017"></A> moving map program. Besides, an embedded HTTP server<A 
  NAME="dx14-85018"></A>
     developed by Curt Olson<A 
  NAME="dx14-85019"></A> late in 2001 can now act a property manager<A 
  NAME="dx14-85020"></A> for
     external programs.

     <LI CLASS="itemize">Manually changing views<A 
  NAME="dx14-85021"></A> in a flight simulator is in a sense always &#8221;unreal&#8221;
     but  nonetheless  required  in  certain  situations.  A  possible  solution  was
     supplied by Norman Vine<A 
  NAME="dx14-85022"></A> in the winter of 1999 by implementing code for
     changing views using the mouse. Alternatively, you can use a hat switch for
     this purpose, today.
     </LI>
     <LI CLASS="itemize">A   property   manager<A 
  NAME="dx14-85023"></A>   was   implemented   by   David   Megginson<A 
  NAME="dx14-85024"></A>   in   fall
     2000.  It  allows  parsing  a  file  called  <SPAN 
CLASS="pcrr7t---109">.fgfsrc</SPAN><A 
  NAME="dx14-85025"></A>  under  UNIX/Linux  and
     <SPAN 
CLASS="pcrr7t---109">system.fgfsrc</SPAN><A 
  NAME="dx14-85026"></A> under Windows for input options. This plain ASCII file
     has proven useful in submitting the growing number of input options, and
     notably  the  joystick  settings<A 
  NAME="dx14-85027"></A>.  This  has  shown  to  be  a  useful  concept,  and
     joystick, keyboard, and panel settings are no longer hard coded but set using
     *.xml files since spring 2001 thanks to work mainly by David Megginson
     and John Check.<A

<!--l. 189--><P CLASS="noindent">During development there were several code reorganization efforts. Various code
subsystems were moved into packages. As a result, code is organized as follows at
present:

are (i) <SPAN

now.
<!--l. 815--><P CLASS="indent">   There are already people working in all of these directions. If you&#8217;re a programmer
and think you can contribute, you are invited to do so.

HREF="getstartap3.htm#x14-88000C.3" NAME="x14-88000C.3">Achnowledgements</A></H4> Obviously this document could not have been written without all
those contributors mentioned above making <SPAN

<!--l. 824--><P CLASS="noindent">First, I was very glad to see Martin Spott <A 
  NAME="dx14-88001"></A>entering the documentation effort. Martin
provided not only several updates and contributions (notably in the OpenGL section) on
the Linux side of the project but also several general ideas on the documentation in
general
<!--l. 826--><P CLASS="indent">   Besides, I would like to say special thanks to Curt Olson,<A 
  NAME="dx14-88002"></A> whose numerous scattered
Readmes, Thanks, Webpages, and personal eMails were of special help to me and were
                                                                     

                                                                     
freely exploited in the making of this booklet.
<!--l. 830--><P CLASS="indent">   Next, Bernhard Buckel <A 
  NAME="dx14-88003"></A>wrote several sections of early versions of that Guide and
contributed at lot of ideas to it.
<!--l. 833--><P CLASS="indent">   Jon S. Berndt <A 
  NAME="dx14-88004"></A>supported me by critical proofreading of several versions of the
document, pointing out inconsistences and suggesting improvements.
<!--l. 836--><P CLASS="indent">   Moreover, I gained a lot of help and support from Norman Vine<A 
  NAME="dx14-88005"></A>. Maybe, without
Norman&#8217;s answers I would have never been able to tame different versions of the <SPAN

CLASS="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </SPAN>couple.
<!--l. 840--><P CLASS="indent">   We were glad, our Mac expert Darrell Walisser <A 
  NAME="dx14-88006"></A>contributed the section on
compiling under Mac OS X. In addition he submitted several Mac related hints and
fixes.
<!--l. 842--><P CLASS="indent">   Further contributions and donations on special points came from John Check,<A

(general layout), Oliver Delise <A
