About a year ago (March 1999), the ISU Aerospace Engineering dept
purchased an PC-based Aviation Training Device or PC-ATD from ELITE
Personal Simulators (www.flyelite.com PCATD Model PI-142) and
Precision Flight Controls.  This package is an FAA certified
instrument trainer.  It is my understanding that one can log a limited
number of hours on this system (with a CFI present) toward an
instrument rating.
<P>

Our major use for this simulator is as a tool to allow students to
relate what they derive on paper to what actually happens in an
aircraft.  The ELITE simulator has excellent detail on the instrument
panel, but the scenery window leaves a lot to be desired.  The sky is
solid blue, the ground is solid green, and there is absolutely no
terrain variation whatsoever.  With this window so small, it is
difficult to "feel" the orientation of the aircraft if you aren't used
to looking at an instrument panel.  We want to implement FlightGear
into this system because of its superior scenery generation and its
use of the LaRCsim FDM.
<P>

Eventually, we envision using the network capability of FlightGear to
create multiple views for the pilot.  We also plan on modifying the
FDM to use different aircraft models.  There is also a budget for
purchasing the materials to build a cockpit around the entire systems
once it is completed.
