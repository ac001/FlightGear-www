<H1>Windows & CVS Tips (WinCVS)</H1>

<HR>

Several people have asked me how to get CVS working on Windows.
Here's what I did:
<P>

<OL>
  <LI> Download WinCVS (and/or MacCVS) from here: 
       <A HREF="http://mirror.openspace.ch/maccvs/">
       http://mirror.openspace.ch/maccvs/</A>
       <P>

  <LI> Install it. As of beta 23 (9-10-98) it has a fancy installer,
       but you still have to unzip it first. So unzip it to a
       temporary directory, then run Setup.exe.  (Incidentally, if you
       don't have WinZip from <A
       HREF="http://www.winzip.com/">http://www.winzip.com/</A>, do
       yourself a favor and get it, it is probably the single best
       argument in favor of shareware that there is).
       <P>
 
  <LI> Run it. It will pop up a dialog box and ask you for a 'CVS
       Root'. Give it this: anoncvs@kenai.me.umn.edu:/cvs/FlightGear 
       <P>

  <LI> In that same dialog, set 'Authentication' to 'passwd' file on
       the cvs server', and version to 1.9
       <P>

  <LI> In the same dialog, go to the 'Globals' tab, and push the
       'Change Folder' button to set the HOME directory. I created a
       'CVSTest' directory on my PC to test it out, but I think the
       could just as easily point to the root of your general
       development tree (a FlightGear directory gets created in here).
       <P>

  <LI> That should be all you need to do in that dialog. Hit OK.
       <P>

  <LI> Now, WinCVS should be sitting there looking like it's waiting
       for you to do something. So, get your IE or Nav up and go to <A
       HREF="anoncvs.html">
       ../cvs.htm/anoncvs.html</A>. This
       is Curt's CVS instruction page.
       <P>

  <LI> The current instructions are for command line, but we can work
       around that pretty easy, since WinCVS has a command line
       dialog. Ignore the first command on that page: it should have
       been done automatically.  NOTE: There's a Tcl/Tk option with
       WinCVS which, if installed, gives you a regular command line in
       the lower right pane.  This might make the next step somewhat
       easier, but I haven't tried it as yet.
       <P>

  <LI> Go to the menu item "CVS Admin / Command Line...". Starting
       with "cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@kenai.me.umn.edu:/cvs/FlightGear
       co FlightGear", cut-and-paste the commands, one at a time, into
       the command line box. (NOTE: the \'s at the end of the lines
       are line breaks (i.e. delete them after you paste the command
       line in). That one threw me at first). If WinCVS asks you for a
       password or username, use 'guest'.
       <P>

  <LI> Wherever the instructions say 'cd ', click on the 'click to
       specify directory' box and use that to change directories. I
       believe they are created automatically by the cvs commands, but
       if not, create them manually.
       <P>

  <LI> Once you finish all the commands, you should have a complete
       Flight Gear directory tree set up.
       <P>

  <LI> On Curt's CVS page, he's got the following command line:
       aclocal ; automake -a ; autoconf. That is supposed to set up
       the config.h file to your specific setup, but Windows doesn't
       have the required commands. I used a config.h from the regular
       source download (I think, might have been from the VC++5.0
       project download). I don't know how else to get around this
       one.
       <P>

       <STRONG>Note from Curt:</STRONG>  aclocal, automake, and
       autoconf are Unix tools which build the configure script and
       construct the Unix makefiles from much simpler input
       files. Windows users will only be able to use these tools if
       they have the cygnus/egcs compiler environment installed. The
       cygnus/egcs packages provides a free windows port of the basic
       unix development tools.

That should do it, just 12 easy steps ;-).
