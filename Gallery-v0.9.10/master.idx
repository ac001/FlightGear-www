<H3>April 2006, Screenshots from v0.9.10</H3>

Version 0.9.10 has completely redone terrain textures derived from
satellite imagery.  Here is a Comanche pa24 flying in the Colorado Rockies
area.

Version 0.9.10 has much improved multiplayer support.  There is even a
multiplayer map server (based on google map technology) that can show
all the active pilots superimposed on top of a google map.

Picture of the Concorde showing our new "theme-able" gui system as well
as our new shadow system where an aircraft will cast shadows on itself
and the ground.

We now have support for seasonal texture sets, 3d clouds, and users
can submit models of buildings, landmarks, towers, or bridges from
around the world for inclusion in the FlightGear scenery.

We have a nicely modeled carrier with a variety of aircraft that can
launch and land with an arrestor hook.

We have new weather effects, thunderstorms, lightning, and rain.  And you
can see the ground and self shadowing effects.  The approach shot shows the
b1900d with it's full 3d clickable instrument panel on approach to Birmingham
International (EGBB) at dusk.

On occasion FlightGear is spotting doing interesting things in the real world.
Here FlightGear is being used as a real time synthetic display for a
University of Minnesota UAV project.  The two images (live video + synthetic
view) were captured at the same time from the same perspective.  You can see
how closely they match.  One of the goals of this project is to pilot the
aircraft solely from the synthetic view.  More details on this project
can be found starting on <A HREF="http://www.flightgear.org/~curt/">my home
page</A> in my 'news' postings.  FlightGear supports insertion of custom,
highly detailed, photo-real scenery models for small areas.

The following pictures show FlightGear as part of a 747 cockpit simulator
with columnated visuals.  You can see more about this project
