UKUUG Linux Technical Conference</A>.  Leeds, England.</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Linux 2004</B>
<P>
A wide cross-section of the Linux community will gather in Leeds
this August for the annual UKUUG Linux Technical Conference.
It's a great way to broaden your knowledge and keep up-to-date
with what's happening in the world of linux.
This low-cost event is for anyone with a serious interest in linux
including systems administrators, linux professionals, developers and
enthusiasts from companies and linux user groups throughout the UK and
beyond.
<P>

The conference starts around 9.45am on Friday, 6th August,
continues with a full day of presentations on Saturday, 7th August,
and finishes about 4.30 p.m. on Sunday, 8th August.
Tutorials will be held on Thursday, 5th August.
<P>

Building upon previous years' events,
this promises to be a very successful conference.
There should be plenty of time for informal discussions.
There will be table-top displays on Friday and Saturday, and,
new this year, a keysigning session.
Places are limited, so early booking is advised.
Please recommend the event to your friends and colleagues
and download our Conference booklet (PDF). 
<P>

<B>The FlightGear Flight Simulator</B>
<P>

FlightGear is a superb open source flight simulation project,
offering the pilot's view of the cockpit and of the 3D scenery.
The simulator pilot uses joystick, keyboard, yoke, pedals and other
input devices to fly any of dozens of realistic aircraft around the
world.
<P>

In order to run well on a commodity computer system, XML files
determine which software modules are to be used and configure each so
they integrate as the desired simulation.  Individual files for
aircraft, engines, instruments and other common components enables the
simulation to reuse these files much like aircraft manufacturers reuse
engines and instruments.
<P>

Connections between software modules are resolved to objects
using a hierarchical namespace that is common to code and XML.
The same namespace is exposed as a network service,
enabling external software to monitor and modify the simulator state.
<P>

This talk introduces the scientific and engineering challenges
and presents some work currently in progress.

History show</A></B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Michael Selig (A UIUC aero professor who is heavily involved with the
FlightGear project) sent me the following interesting tidbit.
<P>

On Wednesday, 18 Dec is the Discovery Channel Unsolved History show:
<P>

The Death of the Red Baron.
<P>

FlightGear was used in the model development for some of the computer
generated footage that went into the production of this show.
However, they they didn't use FG for the final rendering w/ machine
guns blaring away.  When they went to UIUC to do some of the filming,
they took footage of Michael S. flying w/ FlightGear, so it may
possibly appear in the show.  One never knows, however, what will get
lost on the cutting room floor.
<P>
So, if you have nothing better to do, this one might be interesting to
watch.

What:<BR>
  FlightGear is a completely Open Source multi-platform, cooperative
  flight simulation development project.  The FlightGear project is working
  to create a sophisticated flight simulator framework for the development
  and pursuit of interesting flight simulator ideas. It is a solid, basic
  simulator that can be expanded and improved upon by anyone interested
  in contributing.

FlightGear will be featured as part of a submitted paper on using PC's
for flight simulation research.
<P>

<H2>Abstract</H2>
<P>

Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) programme has so far effectively used
high-end image generators for research, development and qualification
work on handling qualities. The flight simulation requirement for
naval variant of LCA presented an opportunity to reassess the fidelity
requirement of each and every component of the simulator considering
technological advancements in PC hardware and graphics
accelerators. The pressing need to innovate solutions which remain
unaffected by import barriers whilst offering unlimited scope for
upgradation led to configuring LCA(Navy) simulator around PCs with
graphics accelerator cards and an OpenSource image generator software
FlightGear <WWW.FLIGHTGEAR.ORG> suitably modified to suit our
requirements. This paper discusses the price/performance advantage of
PC based part-task simulator based on our experience on ski-jump
launch and recovery simulation of LCA (Navy). This simulator has been
successful in providing realistic simulation of carrier-based launch
and recovery for the evaluation and refinement of flight control law.
Essential visual simulation features are identified and their
importance towards achieving visual fidelity are discussed
