<P>

UTC has been using Flightgear as the basis of a research project
started in August, 2001.  It is our goal to provide our Challenger
Center here at the university (and hopefully other centers in the
future) a low cost virtual reality computer simulation.  Our
simulation is using flightgear and JSBSim, specifically the shuttle
module, to develop a shuttle landing simulator.  Currently, we are
trying to get to the point of at least contributing instructions on
how to interface our virtual reality hardware with Flightgear back to
the OS community."
<P>

Our project is funded by the Wolf Aviation Foundation.  Dr. Andy
Novobiliski is heading the research project.  Without Flightgear as a
foundation for this project, we wouldn't have had a project!  It has
been very valuable to us in that we did not have to develop a flight
sim from scratch.  The support of the Open Source Community is another
plus to our project, too.
