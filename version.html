  </UL>


<H3>April 5, 2006: Version 0.9.10 released</H3>
  <UL>
    <LI> Many improvements to the multi-player mode.  Other airplanes are now
  updated smoothly.  There is a really nifty google maps based moving
  map that anyone can use to track all online activity.
    <LI> AI planes have improved ground following and are smarter about
  selecting the active runway.
    <LI> Include the ability to send ATC and AI aircraft communication to a
  local festival server to be converted to spoken speech output.
    <LI> Added a detailed model of the Honeywell MK VIII EGPWS ground
  proximity warning system.
    <LI> Added background ATC chatter.
    <LI> Updated/improved rain cone rendering.
    <LI> Complete overhaul/redo of terrain textures based on USGS
         satellite imagery.
    <LI> Updated manual.
    <P>

    <LI> Upgraded to v2.0 of the JSBSim config file format.
    <LI> Fix a discrepancy in sign of twist and incidence values in YASim
  between code and documentation.
    <LI> Updates to YASim for more fine grained propeller modeling.
    <LI> UFO will now honor elevator trim value so that it will respond to
  the autopilot altitude hold module.
    <LI> UFO can adjust it's speed range so you can use it for super high
  speed world exploration, or extremly fine grained precise positioning.
    <LI> Much work and progress with carrier interaction and launch/recovery
  modeling.
    <P>

    <LI> Add a feature that allows the end user to click any where on the
  terrain.  The system will compute a ground intersection and report
  back the lon, lat, and elevation of the click point.  The click
  point is reported in the property system so it can be read by just
  about anything including external programs.  Later we added the
  ability to place an object at the click point as well.
    <LI> Add a feature to play one-off wav files.  These are qeued and played
  sequentially.  This was then leveraged to build an ATC background
  chatter module in nasal that can be turned on/off at run time.  This
  could also be leveraged for tutorials or other interactive type
  scripts to play prerecorded messages at specific times or under
  specific conditions..
    <LI> Allow clock to report local time as well as universal.
    <LI> Add a model of a KLN89 GPS.
    <LI> Allow nav radios to be slaved to the gps.
    <LI> Allow enabling/disabling of menu entries.
    <LI> Replace old hardcoded frame rate display with a much more flexible
  nasal/gui version.
    <LI> Add a listener function to properties so that nasal code can be
  triggered whenever a property changes.  This is more efficient than
  polling.
    <LI> Add a save-on-exit option to save user preferences.
    <LI> Add support for point sprites.
    <LI> Add support for emissive layers (such as lights) on 2d panels.
    <LI> Updated gui styles.
    <LI> Updated airport and navaid data.
    <LI> Added a new Nasal/XML based tutorial system.

         version of an aircraft, there is only one entry and no
         aliases.  If there are multiple versions of an aircraft, we
         may still have an alias to point to the preferred or default
         version.

    <LI> Added RedHat packaging files.

    <LI> Added some perl script utility functions which are useful

         software application into thinking it is talking to a real
         gps.

    <LI> Fixed a subtle problem with our star database that has been
         lurking for many years, but it took an astronomy expert to
         spot the subtle misalignments.

         afterburner USB, Logitech WingMan Force 3D, Logitech Extreme
         3D Pro USB, and Microsoft SideWinder 3D Pro joysticks.

      configurable with many sound effect improvements. 
      <LI> Separate XML I/O operations into a separate header.
      <LI> Implement a standard FGSubsystem interface for module consistency.
      <LI> Add waypoint dialog now shows entire current waypoint list
      in a scroll box. 
      <LI> Use an LED font for radios (and added infrastructure/support
      for additional fonts.)
      <LI> Continued work on developing a generalized network
      interface to an external flight dynamics model running as a
      separate process on the same or different machine.
      <LI> Initial glideslope and climb rate can be specified from the
      command line. 
      <LI> Fixes and improvements to make ground trimming more robust.
      <LI> Many JSBSim updates and improvements, JSBSim now exports
      all it's interesting internal state via the property manager.
      <LI> Many updates to UIUCsim including support for non-linear
      models, flaps. 
      <LI> Move tower view location when teleporting to a new airport.
      <LI> Created a new /devices subtree in the property manager to
      display current device status.

      <LI> Many YASim updates and bug fixes, autogen contact points
      for collision detection, support for full engine startup
      procedure, minimal support for magnetos, support skid objects
      (non-rolling gear objects), reduce idle power a bit, export gear
      compression amount to the property tree, include wind when
      computing airspeed.

      <LI> Fixes to the property picker/browser.
      <LI> Fixes and updates to the configure script.
      <LI> Several potential memory abuse bugs detected (valgrind) and
      fixed (Melchior) 
      <LI> Fix an instrument panel text bug ... an integer overflow
      could prevent the text from displaying if the panel was turned
      off for more than 37.8 minutes.
      <LI> Fixed a segfault when trying to audibly ident a nav
      station.  Changes in the sound manager code broke some
      assumptions.  
      <LI> Fixed a bug (another int overflow) which could trick the
      event manager into thinking the next time to run the events is
      <B>way</B> in the future.
      <LI> Various performance optimizations.
      <LI> More work on saving/restoring flights
      <LI> Of all the ILS stations of the specified frequency, pick
      the one the most directly points at us.
      <LI> Various restructures in the scenery loading code in
      preparation for more flexible runway lighting support.
      <LI> Fixes/improvements to the scenery/line intersection code.

  <H3>February 13, 2002:  Version 0.7.9pre2 released</H3><P>
    <UL>
      <LI> JSBSim FGPiston mixture improvements
      <LI> Enable Audio by default in MSVC builds
      <LI> Added a clock freeze option.

  <H3>February 12, 2002:  Version 0.7.9pre1 released</H3><P>
    <UL>
      <LI> Switch to JSBSim (jsbsim.sf.net) as our default flight model.
      <LI> Added additional aircraft: Cessna 182, Cessna 172 (ifr panel),
  and a Cessna 310 (twin prop).
      <LI> Added an entirely new set of flight dynamics modeling code by Andy Ross.
  Includes several aircraft such as a 747, A4, and DC-3.
  This is (Y)et (A)nother Flight Dynamics (Sim)ulator.  It is a first cut
  of a "different take" on FDM design.  It's intended to be very simple
  to use, producing reasonable results for aircraft of all sorts and sizes,
  while maintaining simulation plausibility even in odd flight conditions
  like spins and aerobatics.  It's at the point now where one can
  actually fly the planes around.
      <LI> Added an optional embedded http server that provides a property
  manager interface to external programs and scripts.
      <LI> Added an optional embedded http server that can serve out live
  screen shots to anyone on the web.
      <LI> Sync with the latest JSBSim code.
      <LI> Added simple ATIS support.
