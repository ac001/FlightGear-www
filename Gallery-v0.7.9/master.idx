<H1>FGFS [Historic] Photo Gallery - 01</H1>

These are some images that document the historical development of the
project.  They show aspects of the project in it's early stages, and
they show some of the early features we were working on.  The images
are presented in reverse cronological order.  The further down you go
on the page, the earlier the vintage of the picture.

<H3>Runways</H3>

Work has begun on adding runway markings.  Precision, non-precision, and
visual marking schemes will be supported as well as concrete, asphalt, dirt,
and turf surface types.
<P>
Our initial approach to drawing runway lines is to split the runway up into
sections and apply the proper texture to that section.  This way a huge variety
of runways can be constructed with a relatively "few" number of textures.

<H3>Clouds</H3>

Sure, these aren't quite the 3D clouds of "Fly!", but they still look very
nice and have a minimal impact on frame rates.

<H3>Scenery Work</H3>

I have begun an overhaul of the current scenery system to facilitate
adding things like lakes, rivers, urban areas, other land use areas,
and eventually streams and roads.  I finally got tile edge matching to 
work so I have added some new images.  Please note that the frame rate shown
in these images is misleading.  I have a 3dfx voodoo-2 and to take a screen
shot I have to flip the card into "in-a-window-hack" mode which kills 
frame rates.
<P>

Most recently, I have added "urban" areas.

and rivers.)

<H3>Night shots</H3>

Here are some snap shots which show the night sky.  The Sun, Moon,
stars, and planets are all rendered in their correct position in the
sky.  Flight Gear has a large star data base so the stars (and
planets) are rendered with correct magnitude (brightness.)  Also, the
moon is rendered in the correct phase.

The following images shows how the terrain is smoothly lit underneath
the texture maps.

<H3>Irregular Terrain Gridding</H3>

Flight Gear uses sophisticated <EM>irregularly gridded</EM> terrain.
Irregular grids are able to achieve the same detail level as a regular
grid, but with 4-6x fewer polygons.  We use a tool called Triangle
written by Jonathan R Shewchuk (Jonathan_R_Shewchuk@ux4.sp.cs.cmu.edu)
to connect the dots into a Delauney triangulation.
