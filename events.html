<STRONG>Who:</STRONG>
  Andy Ross, of the FlightGear project
<P>

<STRONG>What:</STRONG>
  FlightGear is a completely Open Source multi-platform, cooperative
  flight simulation development project.  The FlightGear project is working
  to create a sophisticated flight simulator framework for the development
  and pursuit of interesting flight simulator ideas. It is a solid, basic
  simulator that can be expanded and improved upon by anyone interested
  in contributing.

<H3>Flight Simulation Conference</H3>

<STRONG>May 24 - 25, 2001 - Moscow, Russia</STRONG><P>

FlightGear will be featured as part of a submitted paper on using PC's
for flight simulation research.
<P>

<STRONG>Abstract</STRONG>
<P>

Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) programme has so far effectively used
high-end image generators for research, development and qualification
work on handling qualities. The flight simulation requirement for
naval variant of LCA presented an opportunity to reassess the fidelity
requirement of each and every component of the simulator considering
technological advancements in PC hardware and graphics
accelerators. The pressing need to innovate solutions which remain
unaffected by import barriers whilst offering unlimited scope for
upgradation led to configuring LCA(Navy) simulator around PCs with
graphics accelerator cards and an OpenSource image generator software
FlightGear <WWW.FLIGHTGEAR.ORG> suitably modified to suit our
requirements. This paper discusses the price/performance advantage of
PC based part-task simulator based on our experience on ski-jump
launch and recovery simulation of LCA (Navy). This simulator has been
successful in providing realistic simulation of carrier-based launch
and recovery for the evaluation and refinement of flight control law.
Essential visual simulation features are identified and their
importance towards achieving visual fidelity are discussed

<H3>LinuxWorld Conference and Expo</H3>

<STRONG>January 30 - February 2, 2001 - New York City</STRONG> <P>

In August, 2000, the FlightGear project set up it's first LinuxWorld
Expo booth.  Alex Perry did such a fine job of organizing things, and
we received so much positive feedback, that we are doing it again.
This time at the Winter LWCE in New York City.  Here is the conference
