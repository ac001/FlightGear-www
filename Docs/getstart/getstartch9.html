<!--l. 13--><p class="indent">   In the cross country flight tutorial, you learned about VFR flight, and in the course of
the flight you were introduced to most of the flight instruments in the C172p. Now we&#8217;re
going to do an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight. In this flight you&#8217;ll be introduced to
the remaining instruments, learn a bit about IFR flight, and learn many, many TLAs
(Three-Letter Acronyms).
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent">   We&#8217;ll fly the same flight, from Reid-Hillview (KRHV), runway 31R, to Livermore
(KLVK), runway 25R, only this time we&#8217;ll do it in IFR conditions: a 750 foot ceiling, and
1 mile visibility. This tutorial assumes you&#8217;ve completed the cross country flight
tutorial.

<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent">This is not intended to teach you how to fly IFR. Rather, it is meant to give a flavour of
what IFR flying is like, and remove the mystery of the panel instruments not covered by
the cross country flight tutorial.

<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent">We need to tell FlightGear about our flight conditions. Depending on which
version of FlightGear you&#8217;re using there are different ways to set our &#8220;desired&#8221;
weather. You need to check your specific version to see what you need to do. In the
command-line version, you need to add the following options when you start
up:

<!--l. 49--><p class="indent">   The first option asks for a 750 foot ceiling, with a thickness of 3000 feet (ie, the
cloud tops are at 3750), the second should be obvious. I strongly recommend also setting
the following, admittedly hairy, option:

but the result is &#8212; when you top out at 4000 feet, you&#8217;ll be able to see for miles (30,000
metres, in fact), including a few peaks poking through the clouds (without this option,
you&#8217;d have 1 mile visibility above the clouds as well as below them). It&#8217;s a small thing,
and not strictly necessary, but there&#8217;s something very uplifting about rising above the
clouds into a bright sunny world, with blue sky above and a carpet of white below, like

markings around the outside. I&#8217;ve helped you by marking their centers with a big blue dot
as well. Reid-Hillview is very close to one, San Jose, which you can see in Figure <a 
href="#x15-1570013">9.3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:sectional_labelled --></a>.
Near the centre of the circle, in a bluish-green rectangle, is the station information.
According to the station information, it&#8217;s is a VOR-DME station (I&#8217;ll explain DME later),
its name is San Jose, its frequency is 114.1 MHz (or Channel 88, which is an alternative
way to say the same thing), and its identifier, or &#8220;ident&#8221;, is SJC (which in Morse code is

the COMM receivers (see Figure <a

gauge. We&#8217;ll choose the NAV1 receiver (and VOR1 gauge) in this case (NAV2
would have worked just as well). Before setting the frequency, check out the
VOR1 gauge. It should look like VOR1 in Figure <a

anything?

an extra dial on the NAV receivers that the COMM receivers don&#8217;t have, labelled
OFF, LO, and HI (see Figure <a 
href="#x15-1580046">9.6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:ident --></a>). That&#8217;s our ident volume control. So, is it
currently off, or low, or high? Unfortunately, it gives no visual feedback about
its current state, so we don&#8217;t really know. The only way to be sure is to turn
it up. Unfortunately, for the same reason, it&#8217;s hard to tell if our mouse clicks
are doing any good, so hit Ctrl-C to see the hot-spots. This control has two
hot-spots, one on the top which increases the volume, the other on the left which

<!--l. 298--><p class="indent">   When you engage the autopilot, CHECK THIS CAREFULLY. Sometimes the
autopilot gets a very funny idea about what your current rate of climb is, like 1800 feet
per minute. Our little Cessna cannot sustain this, and if the autopilot tries to maintain this
(and it will), you will stall before you can say &#8220;Icarus&#8221;. This is a bug, to be sure, and a bit
annoying, but it is also a useful cautionary lesson &#8212; don&#8217;t put blind faith in your
equipment. Things fail. You have to monitor and cross-check your equipment, and be
prepared to deal with problems.

&#8220;ROL&#8221; will change to &#8220;HDG&#8221;, and the autopilot will turn the airplane to track the
heading bug. Since you set the heading bug to the runway heading, and you took off
straight ahead (didn&#8217;t you?), it shouldn&#8217;t turn much.

along the 009 radial from San Jose until we need to turn. But it&#8217;s useful for two reasons:
First, it&#8217;s nice to know exactly where we are. Second, it confirms we are where we think
we are. If we fly and fly and never cross the radial, alarm bells should start going
off.
<!--l. 359--><p class="indent">   Looking at the sectional, we see that the radial is the 114 radial from the Oakland
VORTAC (VOR TACAN, where TACAN stands for Tactical Air Navigation). Oakland&#8217;s
frequency is 116.8, and its ident is OAK (<span

Oakland, but if it isn&#8217;t, do it now. Turn on NAV2&#8217;s volume and make sure you&#8217;re getting
the correct ident.
<!--l. 368--><p class="indent">   When we were on the ground, VOR2&#8217;s needle was flickering &#8212; VOR signals are
line-of-sight, and Oakland was too far away (and behind some hills) for us to receive it
clearly. Soon after taking off, however, it should have settled down, and now it should be
holding steady.
<!--l. 374--><p class="indent">   We need to adjust the OBS, to tell VOR2 which radial we&#8217;re interested in. Set the
OBS to 114. See if you can guess whether the flag should read TO or FROM when we
cross the 114 radial. And see if you can guess whether the needle will move from left to
right or right to left as we cross the radial.
<!--l. 380--><p class="indent">   A final note: There&#8217;s nothing magical about the 114 radial &#8212; we could have used
113, or 115, or 100, or 090. The reason I chose 114 is because there was a line on the
map already drawn along the 114 radial, which saved me the trouble of drawing a line
myself.

<!--l. 387--><p class="noindent">As we continue towards the 009 radial intercept, let&#8217;s look a bit more closely at the
autopilot. First of all, if you aren&#8217;t in the habit of trimming the airplane, you&#8217;ll probably
notice a flashing &#8220;PT&#8221; with an arrow on the autopilot. The autopilot is telling
you to adjust the pitch trim. I tend to ignore it because, flying with a mouse,
trimming is more trouble than it&#8217;s worth. Those of you lucky people with yokes and
joysticks and who find flashing lights annoying might want to trim to get rid of
it.
<!--l. 396--><p class="indent">   Also, on the right there&#8217;s a big knob, the altitude select knob, which we can use to
dial in a target altitude. We&#8217;re going to use it. Turn it until you see our desired cruising
altitude, 4000 feet, displayed on the right. When you started turning it, &#8220;ALT
ARM&#8221; should have appeared in the autopilot display (as in Figure <a 
href="#x15-16300210">9.10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:ap_alt --></a>). This
indicates that you&#8217;ve selected a target altitude. The autopilot will maintain the
current rate of climb until reaching that altitude, at which point it will level off
and change from vertical speed (VS) mode to altitude hold (ALT) mode. In
altitude hold mode it maintains an altitude (in this case our target altitude of 4000

<!--l. 427--><p class="noindent">I assume by this point you&#8217;ve turned onto the 009 radial. Unless you&#8217;re good or
lucky, the needle probably won&#8217;t be centered. We need to adjust our course.
The CDI needle (the vertical needle on the VOR) tells us where to go. If it&#8217;s
to the left, that means the radial is to the left, so we need to go left. Ditto for
right.
<!--l. 433--><p class="indent">   It&#8217;s quite easy in theory, although in practice you may find that it&#8217;s hard to keep the
needle centered, and that you are slaloming down the radial. The key is to realize this: the
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">position </span>of the needle tells us where we <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">are</span>, the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">motion </span>of the needle tells us what to
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">do</span>.
<!--l. 439--><p class="indent">   I&#8217;ll explain. If the needle is to our left, then, yes, the radial is definitely to our
left.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x15-164001f5"></a> 
But if the needle is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">moving </span>towards us, that means we&#8217;re going to cross the radial, sooner
or later, so our situation is improving, and we probably just need to wait for the needle to
center. On the other hand, if the needle is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">moving </span>away, we need to turn towards it to
stop, and reverse, its motion.
<!--l. 448--><p class="indent">   Note that the amount we need to turn is difficult to guess correctly at first, so
experiment. Try 10<sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">&#x2218;</span></sup>. If the needle moves too fast, cut it down to 5<sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">&#x2218;</span></sup> (ie, turn back 5<sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">&#x2218;</span></sup>). If,
on the other hand, the needle moves too slowly, double it to 20<sup><span

the Oakland 114 radial was one way (I assume that by now you&#8217;ve crossed
it). Ahead of us lies the SUNOL intersection. If you look closely, 5 separate
radials join at the point, so we have an embarrassment of choices with regards
to the intersecting radial. Because it will come in useful later, we&#8217;re going to
use the one coming in from the upper right. Another check of the sectional
reveals that this is the 229 radial of the Manteca VOR, 116.0 MHz, ident ECA

check the ident to confirm the station.
<!--l. 471--><p class="indent">   Meanwhile, let&#8217;s introduce another piece of gear on the panel that will cross-check
the SUNOL passage. Some VOR stations have a distance capability, called

(Distance Measuring Equipment). For example, San Jose does (remember it&#8217;s a
VOR-DME station), as does Oakland (VORTAC also means it has DME capabilities). It
turns out Manteca does as well.
<!--l. 480--><p class="indent">   Using DME, you can find out how far you are, in straight-line distance, from the
VOR station. In our scenario, the DME isn&#8217;t necessary, but we&#8217;ll use it anyway, just to
see how it works, and to reconfirm our position.
<!--l. 485--><p class="indent">   The DME is the instrument below the autopilot (refer to Figure <a 
href="#x15-1580024">9.4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:panel --></a>). Probably the
selector is set to N1. The N1 means &#8220;listen to NAV1&#8221;, and since NAV1 is tuned to San
Jose, it&#8217;s telling us the distance to the San Jose VOR-DME. Now switch the DME to N2.
It now shows us the distance to the Manteca VOR.
<!--l. 491--><p class="indent">   The DME shows you 3 things: the distance in nautical miles to the station, your
speed towards or away from the station, and estimated time to the station at the current
speed. Note that the distance is the direct distance from your plane to the station (called
the &#8220;slant distance&#8221;), not the ground distance. Note as well that the speed is relative to the
station, so unless you&#8217;re flying directly to or from the station, it will probably be lower
than your true groundspeed. For example, the speed from San Jose, which is directly
behind us, should be greater than the speed towards Manteca, which is off to the
right.
<!--l. 502--><p class="indent">   If we look up information about the SUNOL
intersection,<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="getstart22.html#fn7x19"><sup class="textsuperscript">7</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x15-165002f7"></a> 
it tells us that it is 33.35 nm (as measured by a DME receiver) from ECA on the 229.00
radial (that&#8217;s what &#8220;ECAr229.00/33.35&#8221; means).
<!--l. 507--><p class="indent">   Now we have two ways to confirm the SUNOL intersection: The VOR2 needle will
center, and the DME will read 33.4 or so. Note that the DME doesn&#8217;t provide us with a
very precise fix here because Manteca is at such an oblique angle. But it does give us a
good warning of SUNOL&#8217;s impending arrival. Moreover, if it has an unexpected value
(like 30), it should raise a few alarm bells.
<!--l. 516--><p class="indent">   You may be wondering what &#8220;HLD&#8221; means (the setting between N1 and N2 on the
DME). It stands for &#8220;hold&#8221;, and means &#8220;retain the current frequency, regardless of
whether NAV1 or NAV2 are retuned&#8221;. For example, if we switch from N2 to HLD, the
DME will continue to display (and update) information to Manteca. Even if we retune
NAV2, the DME will remain tuned to Manteca. This is handy, because it basically
represents a third independent receiver, and in IFR flight two receivers just never seem
like enough.

procedure for all airports. You need to check for your particular airport. In fact,
you usually need to check for your particular airport, runway, and navigation
equipment.
<!--l. 551--><p class="indent">   Our airport is Livermore (KLVK). Let&#8217;s check the information for that airport. Go to <span class="obeylines-h"><a

have IAPs (Instrument Approach Procedures). There are two listed for runway 25R. One
is an ILS (Instrument Landing System) approach, the other a GPS (Global Positioning
System) approach. Our plane has no GPS, but it does have ILS capabilities (I&#8217;ll explain
ILS later), so we&#8217;ll choose that.
<!--l. 559--><p class="indent">   Although Livermore only has two different instrument approach procedures, big

procedures, &#x2026; I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they had a procedure for someone with a

them.

receiver on the plane can receive that signal and tell you, the pilot, &#8220;the station is over
there&#8221;. You just need to tune the receiver and monitor the correct instruments. The
receiver, labelled ADF (Automatic Direction Finder), and the corresponding instrument,
also labelled ADF, are shown in Figure <a 
href="#x15-1580024">9.4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:panel --></a>.
<!--l. 643--><p class="indent">   To tune into REIGA, turn the tuning knob on the receiver until 374 is displayed as the
standby (STDBY) frequency. As usual, use the middle mouse button for big changes
(100 kHz in this case), and the left mouse button for small changes (1 kHz). Then hit the
SWAP button. The 374 is now displayed as the selected (SEL) frequency. The needle on
the ADF should swing around, eventually pointing ahead to the right. This shouldn&#8217;t be
too surprising, since that&#8217;s about where the REIGA NDB is. Like VORs, to
be sure we&#8217;re really tuned into the right station, we need to hear the ident as
well.
<!--l. 653--><p class="indent">   Unlike the NAV receivers, the ADF receiver has a dedicated IDENT switch. Turn it
on, and wait a bit. You should hear something. If you don&#8217;t, though, it&#8217;s possible that the
volume is turned off. Turn the ADF volume up to high (the ADF volume switch works
the same as the NAV volume switch, with the same problems). If you still can&#8217;t hear the
ident, you&#8217;ve either dialled in the wrong frequency, you haven&#8217;t waited long enough, or
you&#8217;re really, really lost.
<!--l. 661--><p class="indent">   Notice there&#8217;s no OBS to set for an ADF &#8212; the needle just points to the station,

identical-looking compass card, so it&#8217;s tempting to believe it acts the same way. It

class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">one </span>radial, the approach heading. We don&#8217;t care about any others, so we don&#8217;t
need an OBS to declare interest in any others. As a reminder, though, move
the OBS to 255, our desired heading. This will remind us where to point our
nose.

href="getstartli1.html#QQ2-15-209" id="x15-1740009.4.8">Intercepting the Localizer</a></h4>
<!--l. 925--><p class="noindent">We&#8217;re now ready to intercept the ILS localizer. When the two minutes on the 030<sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">&#x2218;</span></sup> leg
have passed, make your U-turn to the right to 210<sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">&#x2218;</span></sup>. Soon after you complete your turn,
the vertical (localizer) needle on the ILS will begin to move. And it will move <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">fast</span>, much
faster than the ADF and VOR needles did. A localizer is 4 times as sensitive as a VOR,
relatively small movements of the aircraft make big changes in the needles. You&#8217;ll
probably overshoot, but don&#8217;t worry, because we have around 5 or 10 minutes to get
things straightened out.
<!--l. 935--><p class="indent">   Just remember: don&#8217;t chase the needles. That mantra is now more important than
ever. Those needles are sensitive &#8212; if you just turn left when the localizer needle is to the
left and right when it&#8217;s to the right, you&#8217;ll be flying like a drunken sailor. If
you&#8217;re lucky, the runway will be passing underneath you as you swing across
the track for the umpteenth time. Luck, though, is something we should not
be relying on. Determine on how the needles are moving before making your
move.
<!--l. 944--><p class="indent">   Now that you&#8217;re heading back inbound at 255<sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">&#x2218;</span></sup>, slow to 75 knots, drop a notch
of flaps, and descend to 2800 feet (but no lower). And check for the inbound
passage of FOOTO to confirm your position. And pat your head and rub your
stomach.

href="getstartli1.html#QQ2-15-210" id="x15-1750009.4.9">Intercepting the Glide Slope</a></h4>
<!--l. 951--><p class="noindent">As we fly drunkenly towards the runway, cursing localizers and needles and resolving
never, ever to fly in such crappy conditions ever again, don&#8217;t forget to look at the
horizontal needle, the glide-slope needle. At the start it was high above us, because we
were actually under the glide slope. But as we levelled out at 2800, the glide slope started
coming &#8220;down&#8221; to us. Eventually, you should see the needle start to move down. When
the needle is horizontal, that means you&#8217;re on the glide slope. You won&#8217;t be for long,
though, unless you start descending.
<!--l. 961--><p class="indent">   What&#8217;s a good rate? It depends on our groundspeed. In our case, we&#8217;re going at 75
                                                                     

                                                                     
knots (there&#8217;s almost no wind, so our airspeed and groundspeed are the same), and
it turns out that we need to descend at around 400 feet per minute. With the
autopilot, that&#8217;s pretty easy &#8212; just dial in -400, and you&#8217;re set (but remember to
reduce power to keep our speed at 75 knots, or you&#8217;ll hit the runway going
pretty fast, and be prepared to adjust things if you drift above or below the glide
slope).
<!--l. 970--><p class="indent">   Without the autopilot, it&#8217;s also pretty easy &#8212; just reduce power. How much? In this
case, with our plane, to around 1600 RPM. Again, it depends on many things &#8212;
plane, elevation, winds, weight, &#x2026;, so you&#8217;ll have to adjust things if you see the
glide-slope needle start to move up or down. Like the localizer needle though, &#x2026;
(are you ready?) DON&#8217;T CHASE IT. Watch how it&#8217;s moving, then make your
adjustment.
<!--l. 978--><p class="indent">   Since we&#8217;re on final approach, you might want to drop a second notch of flaps. This
will affect your trim, and you&#8217;ll have to adjust power a bit as well.
<!--l. 982--><p class="indent">   Soon after we intercept the glide slope, we should pass over the outer marker.
Several things will happen more or less simultaneously, all of which confirm your

<!--l. 994--><p class="noindent">After all the excitement of the procedure turn, it will seem like a long way down to the
runway from the outer marker. There&#8217;s not much to do but stare at those needles. In fact,
you&#8217;ll probably stare at them like you&#8217;ve never stared at them before. Take a look around
at the other gauges too, though &#8212; they have useful things to tell you. Is our airspeed
okay? We don&#8217;t want to stall. RPMs about right? If flying manually, you&#8217;ll want to
constantly check the attitude indicator and directional gyro. This being a simulator, we
don&#8217;t have to worry about oil pressure and engine temperature, but you might want to
glance over there anyway, just to get into the habit. And I hope you&#8217;ve done
things like set the mixture to full rich (you did lean it out while cruising, didn&#8217;t
you?).

we can track the glide slope down to an altitude of 597 feet (200 feet above
the runway). At 597 feet we make our decision &#8212; if we can&#8217;t see the runway,
then we have to execute a missed approach. 597 feet is our <span

have been in view soon after. With the runway in sight, you could then turn wildly to get on
