Here's a little update on my flight model progress.  There are
absolutely no visuals except for numbers being spewed across the
screen.

However, I positioned myself at 10,000 feet, 0 velocity, and almost
full throttle.  I accelerated to 559.643 kts (Mach 0.846) before I
made contact with the ground (at a very steep angle.)  So, the thing
dives real well.

My next step is to see if I can get it to take off ...

Later,

Curt.

Hackity hack ...

Well, I think I got something working on the flight model front.  I
created a flight.so module copying parts out of the other modules to
wrap around the ACM flight model code.  I added the module init
function name to static_modules in fgstatdv.h and probably another
place or two in fgmain.c.  I linked it all together, and everything
seemed to work ... !!!

All the control surface values are hardwired in right now, so there's
not much you can do with it other than watch the numbers scroll across
the screen.  I was dabbling with a little autopilot functionality, but
that's a long way from being useful.  I was just kind of playing
around seeing if I could get any sort of stabalized, controlled
flight.  (It's not immediately obvious how to do this, and my first
several attempts met with a fair amount of frustration.)  However,
after a little tutorial from one of my coworkers on simple control
theory, I think I'm now on the right track.  I at least achieved
very stable flight (although not stabalized on the correct value.)

I created a "modules" directory, and put my stuff under there for now,
but I suppose we should talk about how things should be organized.  My
next step is to see if I can get the ACM hud code going.  I realize
most civilian planes are lacking a hud, but for now it will be useful
for seeing what's going on until we can get panels and scenery going.

Talk to y'all later.

Curt.

Dear Curt,

thanks for making my documentation available on the web and
announcing it on list. Maybe, I will get more input this way.

Congratulations to "flying". I have the feeling things are going rather
quick for the developers. Unfortunately those poor people 
as me (and not only me) have still some very basic problems.

- Positive result: After installing the brand new Slackware96 
(2 more hours, they changed the X installation routine once more) 
I got your Linux binary running without installing the additional 
library. Runs just "out of the box". Very nice.
I would suggest placing it on your code WWW page along 
with fgdjg.zip to allow others to try it.

-Problem: I want to 'make' it myself under Linux. Compiling works well.
However, first the two X libraries (libX11 and linXext) were not found.
Is it necessary to add the directory manyally to some path or 
environment variable? I checked and found that the liX11 is a link to
something like libX11.so.6 (or similar) and similar for libXext.
Copying the two libs to the source directory and renaming them as libX11
and libXext resolved the problem. I guess this is a simple problem 
and I only need a small hint.

-More serious: Now it find the libs and goes on linking. 
There remain a few references the linker is unable to resolve: In 
fgloadc at line 119 to 'dlopen', in fgload.c line 132 to 'dlsym' and 
again in fgload.c line 312 to 'dlclose'. Then the linker stops.
Any hint? Did you change the code in any way? Do you have an idea?

-When I try to make the DOS executable myself, compiling and linking 
works (including some warnings) and I really get an executable. 
However this one crashed wehen running. I only get a black scree and
Symify gives the following log:

You should have installed the Debian distribution ... :-) :-) :-)

Both of these problems should be easy to fix.  Rather than copying
libraries around your system, just add in a "-L/usr/X11R6/lib" before
the "-lX11 -lXext".  The -L directive tells the compiler where it can
go searching for libraries.  Finally add a "-ldl" to the end.  This
will resolve the dlopen dlsym problems.  I've been meaning to send
these changes to Eric ... maybe he can read this and update
makefile.linux. ;-) Here is what that section of the makefile should
look like.

fgmain: $(MAINOBJS)
	gcc $(CFLAGS) -o fgmain $(MAINOBJS) -lm -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 -lXext -ldl

Hopefully this will help you on the Linux front.

Curt.

The Linux makefile should have a "-ldl" at the end of the gcc line.
It's optional on sunos, so I keep forgetting to add it.

I'm still trying to figure this one out.  Could you give me the
chipset name and version of your SVGA card?  Which version of allegro
do you have?  

> Do you have any hint or idea? 

What would be really great is if you could zip up your version of
the sources and your DOS executable, then either uuencode and mail
it to me or put it on an FTP server somewhere.  Hopefully I could step
through it and see where things go wrong.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the Kernel front:

  fgscreen, fgpalet and fgkbd now include some support for direct
  frame buffer access under sunos.  I can now run full screen under
  sunos on a sparcstation with a cg3 frame buffer.  (The palette is
  a bit screwed up, though.  I think it has something to do with
  text output to /dev/console resetting the palette.)

  I've got something that compiles under WIN32 (I think) but doesn't
  function properly.  The problem is I don't have a WIN32 machine to 
  compile under, nor do I have a WIN32 cross compiler.  I've been
  compiling using the OPEN32 libraries under OS/2.  Some of the problems
  I have could be related to incompatibilities between OPEN32 and
  WIN32.  The problems I'm having are....

    -  The message queue seems to only be accessible from the main
       thread of the program, not from other threads.  To solve this
       I've removed multithreading for now.

    -  My palette routine is screwed up.  CreatePalette() always
       seems to return a null handle.  The problem could be that
       I don't know what to put into the palVersion field of the
       logical palette.

    -  Something is probably wrong with my blitting code in fgscreen.c
       but it could just be that I don't have a palette.

    -  I don't know if my keyboard handling code is working.

  What does work is:

    -  A window of the correct size opens.

    -  The menu is loaded properly.

    -  The exit function in the menu works.

If there are any WIN32 gurus out there, please take a look at the code
in fgnew.zip

Eric

Dear Curt, dear Eric,

I think we should go on communicating over the list giving
other the chance to follow the arguments.

1) Great success: Following the hints I got from Curt yesterday
I was able to compile successfully under Linux and run the 
compiled binary. I'm really happy about this. Can (re)-write 
now the Linux section of my install guide.

2) Concerning DOS: Yes, Eric, I'll send you my compiled binaries
this evening (have this stuff at home). My Card is an ELSA Winner
PCI with S3 chip. The allegro is the most recent version I got
from the allegro home page (will check this in more detail 
in the evening) and my Compiler is DJGPP 2.0 Following the error 
messages I have the feeling the crash is just on the point where
the program switches the video mode. Which version of DJGPP
do you have, Eric? I have the feeling that D.J. Delorie changed
something in the video setup; I remember that in the 1.x versions
there were some explicit video drivers *.gid (or similar) which are 
missing now. BTW: The precompiled fgdjg.zip runs perfectly on the
same machine. Further, this is actually the DOS 7.0 of Win95,
however I can hardly imagine thet this is the reason.

3) Concerning win32 support: I have a Win95 machine with the
Cygnus version of GCC installed. (Perhaps I should look for
alterbative options.) Could do some testing if this
is necessary. The makefile provided for win32 support in the
latest version of fgnew.zip does not run with the cygnus compiler 
(was to be expected from having a glance on it).
One warning: I can do some testing and would really like to
help with this, but I'm not familiar enough with C to rewrite code
myself.

4) Matt Pickering is already doing ''something'' on win32 support,
perhaps you can coordinate with him, especially ask him about
the compiler he uses.

Dear Eric,

I zipped/uuencoded my whole flightgear compilation
directory and will send it to you by
separate mail not to bother the list too much.

However, I made a crusial observation: According to
the header file allegro.h I'm working with allegro 2.1
while you are working with allegro2.0 beta. There were
several more or less substantial changes in between
from 2.0beta to 2.0 release and again from 2.0 release
to 2.1, according to the history file. I tried
"downgrading" to 2.0 but was uanable to find it anywhere on the
net.

One more sign is the fact that compiling with the allegro.h
you provide I always get an 'unterminated if' statement.
I guess, there is no unterminated if, however. In addition, I observed
that my allegro.h is 24 kByte while yours is considerably
smaller (9k or 2k, don't remember exctly). For compiling,
I took my own allegro.h from allegro2.1

I provide two log files for debugging. fltgear.log is the
log from compilind while fltgear2.log is the symified log from
running the exe.

Hope this helps.

The WIN32 version finally displays stuff to the screen.  To
only problem seems to be how slow BitBlt() is.  (I get less than
half the frame rate I do under OS/2 DIVE).   There still seems to
be a Palette problem, though.

I'm on my way to San Diego, so I don't even have time to upload
the new code, or play with Michael's DJGPP problem.  I'll be
back Wednesday.

Next the WIN32 keyboard support.

Eric,

I am writing to ask you if you would be willing to add an arc
drawing routine to fggrx.[hc]  I need this for the HUD code I'm
working on.

I have some sample code to do this (borrowed again from acm.)  It
looks like in this code, angles are in the range of (0*64 - 359*64).
I think (x,y) is the center of the ellipse.  width and height define
the bounding box of the ellipse.  angle1 and angle2 are the starting
and ending angles for which to draw the arc (or portion of the
ellipse.)  Feel free to munge it up however you like and
flight-gear-ize it.


#define TICKtoRAD(a)    (a * M_PI / (180.0 * 64.0))
#define INCR            (30 * 64)

void VDrawArc (int x, int y, int width, int height, int angle1, 
	       int angle2, int color)
{
        register double w, h, xc, yc;
        register int    incr, x1, x2, y1, y2;

        w = width / 2.0;
        h = height / 2.0;
        xc = x + w;
        yc = y + h;

        if (angle2 < 0) {
                incr = - INCR;
                angle2 = - angle2;
        } else {
                incr = INCR;
	}

        if (angle2 > 360*64) {
                angle2 = 360*64;
	}

        x1 = xc + (w * cos(TICKtoRAD(angle1)));
        y1 = yc - (h * sin(TICKtoRAD(angle1)));

        while (angle2 != 0) {
                angle1 += incr;
                angle2 -= INCR;
                if (angle2 < 0) {
                        angle1 -= angle2;
                        angle2 = 0;
                }
                x2 = xc + (w * cos(TICKtoRAD(angle1)));
                y2 = yc - (h * sin(TICKtoRAD(angle1)));
                DrawLine (x1, y1, x2, y2);
                x1 = x2;
                y1 = y2;
        }
}

Dear Eric, dear Curt, dear..

first one remark on the makefiles.
In a private mail, Curt made the 
suggestion of perhaps trying to look for 
a better solution substiting the
different makefiles. I would 
support this idea prefering some sort
of Gnu autoconf or a similar tool.
Several years ago I remember my struggle 
with compiling SLIRP 
(full internet via ASCII terminal 
console, huh...). I had a lot of problems 
adapting the code to my HPUX or AIX at 
that time. After they changed to autoconf 
all went very smoothly. I remember it 
checked automatically the libraries installed, 
the Unix version etc.
If I recall right ACM has a similar
routine. Don't know if it's general enough
to cover all the systems we want to include,
though.

Of course there's nothing for free:
I think, however, it's simpler
to switch to this procedure at the very 
beginning and debugging this one with 
only few code than doing it later.

On another point:
Eric pointed out that his win32
version (For me still unclear
how to build natively under win95) 
is substantially slower than, for instance, 
the OS/2 version. I can well imagine this.
Pure windows (incl.95) is always slow.
Wouldn't it be appropriate for a graphics intense
project as this to make use of the DirectX API?
(Nearly) all commercial win95 game developers
make use of this. The corresponding SDK is freely 
available from MS, although I don't know how 
difficult it's to use.

The runtime libraries of the most recent version
directX3 available from

http://www.microsoft.com/gamesdev/gsdk/directx.zip

are "only" 6MB (freely available from MS
as well). The development kit at

http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/directx3.htm

is araund 80MB(!), if I recall right.
Includes 'some' documentation.
To my best knowedge (as a non-developer) this is
the de-facto standard in win95 games programming
(including Fs95). The point is, that it leaves only
a very thin layer between your code and the hardware.
If I recall right, it even works on NT4.0.

Dear Group,

just by chance I detected another Flight Simulator 
on the net which is freely distributed under the
terms of the GPL. Sources are included. It's
supposed to support DOS/WIN(G) as well as Linux and
some others systems. Name is Fly-8, author is
Eyal Lebedinsky.

Should be interesting for our project.

I remember I tested it some time
(years?) ago, was not overwhelming at that time,
but might me better now (recent version is more than a year 
old, though). In any case, the sources might
be interesting for you developers (do you hear, Curt...?)

Address is:

ftp://ftp.canberra.edu.au/pub/ise/eyal/fly8/released/

Please, excuse me, if this was detected before
and I've missed this.

Hi Guys,

I'm back from San Diego and hoping to get back to work on the code soon.  
Here are some responses to the messages that arrived in my absence.

I agree, but know little of the use of autoconf.  The multiple makefiles
option is less than optimal.  Is someone out there willing to check out
autoconf and send back a report of what needs to be done to support it?
I've noticed that most configuration programs are scripts which is problematic
for systems without /bin/sh,/bin/csh and no job control.

I think we should support portions of DirectX, but that the base WIN32
routines also be available.  As far as I know DirectX is not supported
on NT.  (My past experiences with NT give me the feeling that direct
access to the video subsystem will not be supported.) I'll attempt to 
add code that determines whether the WIN-G API is available at run time.

I've looked at it before, but was unimpressed.  I'll take a look at the
source, though.  Just to see how the WIN-G API is used in it.

It's on my to-do list...  :)

I stand corrected.  Does anyone here know what the relationship
between DirectDraw and WinG is?  Is DirectDraw an object oriented
interface to WinG, or has WinG been abandoned in favor of DirectDraw?

Dear Eric,

only a short remark: If I'm not completely wrong
DirectX IS supported by the release version of NT4.0
I've heared that FSFW95 running on NT4.0 can be configured
to make use of it.

 I stand corrected.  Does anyone here know what the relationship
 between DirectDraw and WinG is?  Is DirectDraw an object oriented
 interface to WinG, or has WinG been abandoned in favor of DirectDraw?<<


 Yes WIN G was the earlier technology. Direct Draw has replaced it. WING used
to run on win 3.1 with the wins extensions. Direct Draw is WIN95 only.

AFAIK, WING has been abandoned in favor of DirectDraw and the DirectX
family. If I recall correctly WING still used the GDI and would not be
effective for what we are trying to accomplish. DirectX is targeted towards
Win32 and will eventually support NT, I believe NT4.0 has DirectDraw
support for most video cards, but not Direct3D yet.

I also sent out a message a week or 2 ago concerning a 32-bit graphics lib
developed by Scitech Software (developers of UNIVBE). It is free for
non-commercial use and supports all SVGA modes in a dos extender or Win32
environment. Available for download from www.scitechsoft.com. Look for the
SVGA Kit v6.0.

I have it on my PC, but haven't had the time recently to play with it. It
has libs for Borland and Watcom in addition to MS Visual C++, so there is a
remote possibility it could be ported to other compilers as well.

How unfortunate.  DirectDraw has such a horrible MFCified interface.

Dear group,

just got my latest issue (6/96) of the Computer Pilot
Magazine today. There is a regular column on net
ressources.

Only to mention, this time there is a figure
showing the Flight Gear home page set up by Curt
and a short (correct) description of the project.

Congratulations!

Dear Eric,

to push tings a little further, can you send me
the liballegro you use (I guess 2.0 beta), best
would be the whole packe allowing me to build
it this way myself. I could check then if
my DJGPP compiling problems are really caused
by liballegro, as I guess.

Thanks Michael Basler (pmb@rz.uni-jena.de)

Hi guys...

Just wanted you to know that I've registered the following channels with DALnet:

#fsnews (FSNews, stop in on Saturday nights @ 10pm EST... flight sim news)
#flight-gear (Flight Gear Flight Simulator, developers chat, etc.)

I am currently the only op in these channels, however, if anyone is
interested in being an op, especially for #flight-gear, please let me know
(reply to: dmurr@pen.k12.va.us).

Thanks and regards,

I've put an updated fgnew.zip on my web site.  This new version now
should support Allegro 2.1.  I think I was able to make it much less
allegro version dependant.

Someone with GCC for Win32 may want to compile it with WIN32 defined.  
(I took a guess at a win32 makefile, but since I don't have a compiler, 
it's just a guess.)  If you do compile it and the compile bombs, please 
send me the compiler error messages.  If it doesn't bomb during compile, 
but does during the run, please debug it if possible.

It's also able to compile under RSXWDK (16 bit version, not RSXNT)
but it doesn't run.  Given RSX's lack of debugging support, there's
not much I can do to find out what's wrong.  It may be gagging on
the remaining printf and fprintf statements.  (I also get a lot of
warnings for RC.EXE that could have something to do with it.)

Support for the ALT keys is missing from both the allegro and Win32
versions.  It's not very high on my priority list right now.

The next things on my list:
  Circles, Arcs and elipses for Curt.
  Dialog Boxes.
  Testing the palette code.
  Exporting static symbols.
  Documenting the API
  WIN32 DirectDraw.
  WIN32 threading.
  Macintosh port?
  Sound?
  24 bit color?

If anyone wants to donate a copy of Windows 95 or NT to the effort,
it would greatly help.  (Or if anyone wants to take over the WIN32
effort.)

Volunteers for any of the above would be graciously accepted.

Eric

Dear Eric, Dear Group,

glad to hear that you're busy again with the code.
I will test it, of course, with allegro 2.1
and send a report.

Concerning win32: My true question to anyone on this
list is: Which one is the "standard" GCC for win32?
A search gave me only the cygnus compiler. This one is
GCC and it is win32, however it is a little bit tricky 
because it relies on a the whole bundle of tools from
the cygnus project doing "some kind of UNIX-emulation"
under win95/winnt. For instance: you have to install
a sh or a bash for making it work etc. But, if there
is nothing else out I will try to get the beast working;
initially after some final trouble (not code but compiler 
specific) I gave up.

Concerning windows95. I would say: I'm not a friend of 
large funds with a huge amount of management. But if 
Eric will go on working on the project I would be willing 
to spend some money on a win95 for him. At the moment, 
the price for an update (he should find an old win3.1 
somewhere) in Germany is (transferred to $) around 
120$. From my experience, I guess, it's cheaper in 
the states. I would be willing to contribute 30-40$.
Anyone out there wanting to share the rest?  In case
of positive answer I would simply take the money
in cash, put it in an envelope and snail mail it
to Eric. Did this several times to the states
without any trouble.

Greetings Michael (pmb@rz.uni-jena.de)

Dear Eric,

my CONGRATULATIONS. Flight gear compiles
and runs with allegro 2.1 now. 
Still some error messages during
compiling, but it runs. Good work.

One comment: Most time I compile and run
under win95 dos7.

Greetings Michael Basler (pmb@rz.uni-jena.de)

I've had this same question.  I've downloaded RSXNT, but
I can't view the help file.  (It requires the Win 95 or NT
version of winhlp32,  my win32s (3.0) version doesn't work.)
It appears that it would work in compiling the source, but 
I can't test it.

I think there is (or eventually will be) a way to use the cygnus
compiler without having to use the cygwin32 UNIX emulation.
I'll have to look into it further.  

I've managed to get my hands on a used copy of Borland C++ 4.0
and I'll try in the next couple of days to build a Win32s version
under it.  It's already pointed out some fallacies in my programming.
(I was doing pointer addition with void pointers, which works under
GCC but is not ANSI)

I have win3.1, so that's not a problem.  Now that I have the Borland
compiler I may not need Win95 (until I dig into the DirectX stuff).  
I'll let you know in the next week or so.

Dear Eric, Dear Group,

it should indeed be possible to work with
the cygnus compiler without all that UNIX
stuff. I really like UNIX, but a mixture between
DOS, Windows and UNIX where you never now where
to write / or \ is horrible.

In the meantime I found a site describing
a simpler installation based on the cygnus compiler,

http://www.fu.is.saga-u.ac.jp/~colin/mingw32.html

Seems promising. I'll play with it during next days.

To quote from this site:
"Setting up the GNU [win] compiler so that
it works is problematic for most experienced 
programmers. For newbies it's a nightmare."

I know a bit on RSXWIN/RSXNT from the TeX/LaTeX
world. Eberhard Mattes makes use of it for
adapting his emTeX package to windows.
Essentially, it turns a DOS program into a true
GUI program. If I recall right, it's limited
to a command-line interface (which is not a problem 
for TeX being command-line oriented) and unable to
run any graphics. Perhaps not a good starting point
for a flight simulator...

Next: I think you can do win32 programming under
win3.1/win32s. However, there are some essential
differences and you will miss several points,
one of the most important one being the use of the
registry database and, as you mentioned, directX
support. You can of course do some stuff this way,
but for a professional program (flight gear
should be one, shouldn't it) I would prefer a 
native win95/winnt4.0 program using the registry,
the win95 installation procedure etc. If you 
find a machine to have a look on  Pascal 
Meziats recently released Airport 2.0
which is win95/nt4.0 and which is free,
you will see what I mean.

I heared that Matt Pickering (address on the
Flight gear home page, perhaps you can find a 
way to co-ordiante your work) is already working on
the win 95 stuff using the Borland compiler, too.
(If I recall right.) From my point of view (as
a non-developer) this idea might not be too
good as a long-term solution for a (free) GNU
project. I would really prefer working with 
free stuff only (maybe up to the OS, 
but we have Linux...)

Sorry, I just discovered that I may be
wrong with my statement of rsxnt not
supporting GUI applications. This
was obviously based on an older version.

Dear developers,

I would like to announce that I was able to
make the first running windows95 port of
flight gear, "Flight Gear 95".
For this pupose, I exploited
the rsxnt port of gcc made by Rainer Schnitker.
In view of the struggle I had with several
versions of win95/nt gcc I found it a nice
success to see flight gear running in a true 
win 95 gui window.

Basically, I adapted the makefile.rsx provided
by Eric Korpela, but had to make some changes.

I will send the makefile to Eric for
including it into the next "release".

In addition, I will send the working win95 binary
to Curt Olson asking him to make it available on the
server.

A more detailed description on how to setup the
compiler and how to compile will be included
in the next version of my installation manual.

Good work Michael!

I have placed the zip file you sent me at:

    http://www.menet.umn.edu/~clolson/fgfs/code/Fgwin32.zip

This is the Windows 95 version of Flight Gear.  Again, this is not a
flight simulator, just the initial structure and low level libraries
around which Flight Gear is being built.

Curt.

Got this today. I didn't know people used Amigas anymore,
except for video and computer graphics... might be something to

I've updated fgnew.zip once again.  The big changes this time:

- I've changed the form of public variables to something a bit more
  logical.  All public variables are in one structure.  The macros
  previously defined for public variables (i.e. AC_TIME_MS, ACATT_PITCH, etc)
  will still work, they just won't contain explicit pointer aritmetic.
  This was necessary for portability reasons.

- I still wasn't able to get the Win32 version to compile on my machine.
  Instead I was able to build a Win16 version which works except for the
  palette stuff.  The executable is in fgwin16.zip.  None of the changes
  should break the Win32 version. (Michael, let me know!)  Unfortunately I
  had to write my own memory management routines.  They are in fgwin16.zip

- I changed a lot of thing that had the type "int" or "FG_INT" to "FG_INT32"
  Some things weren't working well with 16 bit ints.  This will help
  the Macintosh port once I get around to it.

- Michaels makefile for RSXNT is named "makefile.rnt"  I'm still hoping
  to have a working RSXWDK (works with 3.1) version.  (Hasn't happened
  yet.)

- I got some suggestions by mail that haven't gotten put in yet, maybe
  on Thanksgiving :)

There's no reason it couldn't be done.  I know nothing about the Amiga,
however.  (Then again I didn't know anything about Sun frame buffers
either.)

I'll try the new stuff tonight.

There are a few things left over to consider
for the win32 port.

1) When running the makefile make looks
always for a compiler called "cc". I had to
manually copy gcc to cc, then it works.
I don't understand this, because in the makefile
the compiler is defined as "gcc". Eric, do you
have an idea?

2) I still have some trouble with adding the resources.
The binary I sent to Curt does not have them linked
in (although it's a true win32 bit version running 
in a windows).
In the mean time I was able to link them in thus
connecting the .exe with the icon and have the small
"menu" of the window working. The problem is with the
OS/2 stuff in the .res file rsx doesn't like. If I
remove this it works. I will deal with this during
next days myself.

3) I'm just about to update the "Getting Started" including 
installation and running of the rsx compiler.

Actually, what I should do is use the macro $(CC) in the makefiles.
I think this will be properly set up on most machines.

The .res file needs to be recompiled using a Win32 RC.  The
RC file should compile fine under a win32 version of RC as long
WIN32 (or RSX) is defined and USE_OS2_RC is not defined.

Thanks for the info...

Dear Eric.

That's a report on your recent fgnew.zip.

1) The win16 verison, fgwin16.zip, does not 
run on my system, at least not under win95. 
I installed the Borland .dll as required. 
The only result is a file Debug.out which 
is exactly 0 Byte long. Sorry. 
Perhaps a missing .dll?

2) The DJGPP verison compiles out of the box. Fine.
It even runs in a true windows 95 window, 
not only full screen. Actually there are 
very few DOS graphics applications which are
able to run this way. Must be clean programming, 
I guess.

Could you add the dll.o to the package thus making
it unnecessary to load the whole dll101.zip package?

3) No problems with compiling and running 
under win95 with rsxnt. I still need to find 
the right way to link to the resources via the 
makefile.

Two minor topics:
4) There are two .ico files (one OS/2, one win?).
One is called FGWIN.ICO, the other one fgwin.ico.
On systems which don't see the difference this is perhaps 
not a good idea. While unzipping I'm asked to override the 
first one.

5) The default fltgear.ini settings were better before. 
Resolution is rather low for the DOS version while the win32 
version is running in a very small window. No way to change 
it's size (besides changing the .ini, of course). Finally, 
it should be possible to rescale the window, shouldn't it?

I think, I was able to isolate the problem with the
resources in the rsxnt (win32) version.

With a simple fgres.rc as
--------------------------------
#include "fgdefs.h"
#include "fgres.h"

FG_PROGRAM_ID ICON "fgwin.ico"
--------------------------------
compilation is o.k. and the icon is linked
to the .exe.

However with
--------------------------------
#include "fgdefs.h"
#include "fgres.h"

#ifdef RSX
FG_PROGRAM_ID ICON "fgwin.ico"
#endif
---------------------------------

this does not work. Thus, I guess 
there's no problem with the OS2
stuff but with grc not understanding
the if/endif syntax (might this really
be?)

If I remove all "if.." statements
and leave only the RSX stuff all compiling/linking
goes o.k.

Very strange. At this point I don't know
how to proceed. A temporary solution I suggest
might be a separate fgresnt.rc for only rsxnt.

I'll try to figure out what DLL's it needs and add them to the
distribution.

That's good news!

Can do. I'll probably give it a slightly different extension
and have the makefile copy it to dll.o  (I often find myself
doing an "erase *.o")

Let me know when you find out.

I hadn't noticed that.  I will correct the zip file by getting
rid of the upper case version.

I've changed it back to 640x480.  (I was running 200x200 on X over 
a 14.4kbps connection.  Even that was really slow, but I could tell
it worked.)  Eventually I'd like to get rescaling into the X, Win32
and OS/2 versions.  All of the drivers that use bitmaps will need
to hook the FG_BITMAP_CHANGE message in their init functions.  Don't
know when I'll get to it.  Just letting you know that it has been thought
of.  Dynamic resolution changes for other systems will have to be
keyboard or mouse event driven (CTRL-SHIFT-'+' and CTRL-SHIFT-'-'?).
Which reminds me that mouse support is lacking.

Eric

It's possible that grc.exe isn't finding the C preprocessor.
It's also odd that I don't see -D listed among the options.
Could you try the following with the archive version of fgres.rc?

grc -DRSX -cpp cpp.exe -v -r fgres.rc

grc -DRSX -DRC_INVOKED -cpp cpp.exe -v -r fgres.rc

Please send the output to me.  And, of course, if either works, let me know :)

Actually, I'd rather keep the changes in the makefile.  We should be
able to run the c preprocessor manually and then run grc on its output.
The biggest problem is getting the includes and the predefined symbols
right.

We can certainly use all the help I can get.  If you haven't joined
the mailing list yet, please do so by sending mail to majordomo@infoplane.com
with a message body of "subscribe flight-gear"

ATC hasn't been discussed in a while, so I'm unsure if anyone has made up
any specs for this.  I'm not really sure if the ATC support should be
considered a client or a server. :)  It would be great to have designated
ATC servers providing positive control (where required) either automatically
from the server, or manually by someone connected to the ATC server via
a client.  The ATC server could also provide dynamic scenery (regularly 
scheduled flights).  I sort of envision connetions and messages like....

** server = ATC/dynamic scenery server
** Flight Gear client = flight gear program
** ATC client = ATC client
** client = either flight gear or ATC client

server->Flight Gear client: Interrogate Transponder
Flight Gear client->server: (if transponder on and in range return 
		                  pos,vel,transponder code)

client->server: Request nearby traffic (pos,radius)
ATC Server->Flight Gear client: (list of nearby traffic pos,vel,code)

client->server: register com frequency (flags VOICE,TEXT,BOTH)
server->client: (acknowledge) add to list of clients on frequency

client->server: unregister com frequency
server->client: (acknowledge) remove from list of clients on frequency

client->server: text message on frequency
server->client: (acknowledge) send message to all in range on frequency

client->server: voice message on frequency
server->client: (acknowledge) send message to all in range on frequency

ATC client->server: Become controller for sector
server->ATC client: (Acknowledge yes or no.)

server->servers for ajacent sectors: handoffs, etc.

This is a beginning, so it is undoubtably incomplete.  The exact format of the
message and which TCP ports are to be used is up to the developers.  I'd
hope to keep the message sizes to a minimum (which is hard to do on voice).
For now ATC commands would have to be text.  (It would be hard for the
server to change voice into a command for dynamic scenery.)  I'm sending
this to the mailing list so others that are interested can help you
develop a spec and protocols.

It looks great.  Send a copy to Curt Olson to put on the web page!
BTW, what is Fly by Wire?

So far most of the programming is done in C for portability.  I don't know
if Delphi can be made portable (through Gnu Pascal??) or not.

To make the packets as small as possible, as much of the info as possible
should be registered at primary connect and the transponder packets should
be as small as possible.  The4 net is so overloaded as it is, I don't want 
to be sending 1k when 32 bytes would suffice.

I was thinking that non-human controllers would just be mechanically
assigning SIDS and STARS and spacing by time/altitude enroute.  The hard part
would be getting a clearance across sectors.  Flight plans would have to
be available network wide.  VFR traffic would be ignored.  I don't think
it's that unrealistic.

I don't see why dynamic traffic has to be dumb.  The basic instructions
aren't that difficult to follow.  (ATC is able to hook up to FS4 and control
dynamic scenery.)

They are free, in fact.  They produce 32 bit code and in general are very
portable between platforms.

> I'm sure Delphi won't port well--if at all.

It probably depends upon how opject oriented you get.  I don't think GPC
supports borland's object extensions as yet.  The GUI stuff very non-portable.

Agreed.  It's mainly that a communication standard has to be developed.

Not as yet.  If you know where/how to get it, I'm listening :)

Dear Eric et al.

sorry, bad news. I'm still trying to compile the resource file
fgres.rc to fgres.res with rsxnt.

I start with a clean package and only type in (without any 
makefile)

grc -DRSX -cpp cpp.exe -v -r fgres.rc

The result is as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------
F:\Fltgear\Compile.rnt>grc -DRSX -cpp cpp.exe -v -r fgres.rc
compiling file: fgres.rc, start at line: 1

compiling file: fgdefs.h, start at line: 1

compiling file: fgdefs.h, start at line: 40

compiling file: D:/EMX/INCLUDE/os2.h, start at line: 1

compiling file: D:/EMX/INCLUDE/os2emx.h, start at line: 1

compiling userres

compiling userres 

................and so on
----------------------------------------------------------

Either there is something wired in fgdefs.h directing 
the compiler to the OS/2 stuff or the grc itself is wired.

There is a remark in the docs stating 
"There are some bugs in this tool."
The first one can be detected immediately by asking grc -?

F:\Fltgear\Compile.rnt>grc -?
usage: rcl <options> rcfile

        options:
        -fo res_file    .res output file
        -l id           language id
        -v              verbose mode
        -r              (optional) build only .res
        -G              (extention) debug mode
        -cpp cpp_file   (extention) name of preprocessor

Nice, isnt't it? The tool forgot it's own name.
BTW, there is no -D option mentioned. Either
it's only not listed with grc -? (unprobable) or it's really
missing.

The grc is not part of the recompiled emx package but done by
Rainer Schnitker. If we continue having trouble I should
perhaps mail him.

Sorry, but I think we should really find a way to solve this one.
I will help what I can do.

Greetings Michael

Dear Eric et al.

good news. The makefile you sent me a few hours ago
does it's job pretty well. The resources are compiled
in and all is o.k. now. 

I only had to tweak the syntax slightly, I guess you
wanted win95 to have a few lessons on UNIX (-;
I append the final version of makefile.rnt.

On this occasion I removed the absolute paths of the
tools for relative ones. For other people they are
useless anyway. I found that compiling/linking
works pretty well without them
provided the RSX environment is properly set which
is necessary anyways.

BTW, when speaking about resources, a win helpfile
would be nice (perhaps not now, but later).
Even better would be a pro-help
from which a win help as well as a man page and...
can be generated. The GnuPlot (good free multi-platform
plotting program) people do it this way.
While I like the general idea their .doc format is perhaps
not the best. Sometime I will have a closer look
at this.

Greetings Michael (pmb@rz.uni-jena.de)

Good to hear, I'll put the modified version in the next
release.

Yep, I often forget that rm, cp, mv and the like aren't
universal. :)

Great idea, let me know what you find out.  There may be something
somewhere that converts texinfo files into hlp, but I'm not to fond
on the texi format either.

Eric

P.S.  How do the colors look under Win95?  Do they match the DJGPP
      colors, or are we still having palette problems?

Will check this later.

I found that you can simplify the makefile further
by removing the $libdir definition and the
reference to it in the compiler call. If properly installed,
this one is set in the environemt for rsxnt.

----------------------------------------
I just finished a new version of the installation guide including
the win32 stuff and will send it to Curt tonight.

Eric, after downloading the most
recent fgnew.zip with the new
makefile structure I detected that
the makefile.rnt again does not work.

"No rule to make target fgres.res.."

Obviously, grc is again too stupid to
understand your highly developed syntax.
However, a slight correction does the job.

The working makefile.rnt is again appended.

Compiling with DJGPP works well. No need any more
to copy the dll.o manually. Fine.

The palette is definitely different under DOS
and win32, sorry.

Greetings Michael
