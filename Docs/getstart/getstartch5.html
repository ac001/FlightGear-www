href="getstartli1.html#QQ2-10-98" id="x10-980005.2.2">Launching from the Catapult</a></h4>
<!--l. 163--><p class="noindent" >Once FlightGear has started, you should ensure that the parking brakes are off and press
and hold &#8220;L&#8221; to engage the launchbar. You must hold down &#8220;L&#8221; until the launch bar has
engaged. You should notice the aircraft being pulled into alignment with the catapult and
see the strops appear and hold down the aircraft. This will only happen if your aircraft is
close enough to the correct spot on the catapult; as a rough guide, for the default parking
position the seahawk&#8217;s nose should be rougly level with the deck observation
bubble.
<!--l. 170--><p class="indent" >   To get the carrier into as good a position as possible for launch, select the &#8220;ATC/AI&#8221;
menu, then check the &#8220;Turn into wind&#8221; box under the &#8220;AI Carrier&#8221; section. You
should now notice the carrier begin to pick up speed and turn into the wind,
and naturally the deck may tilt somewhat as it turns. You should wait for this
maneuver to finish and the deck to return to level before moving on to the next
stage.
<!--l. 175--><p class="indent" >   Being attached to the catapult, you should spool up the engines to full power, ensure
the brakes are off and that all flight controls are in a suitable position for launch
(stick held right back with the seahawk.) When ready, press &#8220;C&#8221; to release the
catapult. Your aircraft will be hurled forward off the deck, and you should be
able to raise the undercarriage and climb slowly away, being careful to avoid
stalling.

href="getstartli1.html#QQ2-10-99" id="x10-990005.2.3">Finding the Carrier - TACAN</a></h4>
<!--l. 182--><p class="noindent" >Actually finding the carrier in a vast expanse of open water can be very difficult,
especially if visibility is poor. To assist with this task, Nimitz is equipped with TACAN,
which allows a suitably-equipped aircraft (including the Seahawk) to obtain a range
and bearing to the carrier. First, you must set the appropriate TACAN channel,
                                                                     

                                                                     
029Y in this case, in the radios dialogue (ctrl-r or choose Equipment/Radio
Settings from the FG menubar). You should, if within range, notice the DME
instrument show your distance from the carrier, and the ADF instrument (next to
the DME in the seahawk) should indicate a bearing to the carrier. Turn to the
indicated heading and you should see the DME dial indicate your closing in on the
carrier.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.2.4    </span> <a 
href="getstartli1.html#QQ2-10-100" id="x10-1000005.2.4">Landing on the Carrier</a></h4>
<!--l. 193--><p class="noindent" >This is the most difficult part of the operation, as in real life. You might well find
Andy Ross&#8217; tutorial on operating the A4 Skyhawk useful. It is available from
here:

<!--l. 199--><p class="indent" >   Once you have used the TACAN to locate the carrier, you must line up with the rear
of the flight deck. As this part of the deck is at an angle to the course of the vessel,
you may need to correct your alignment often. Ensure that the aircraft is in
the correct configuration for approach (the Help/Aircraft Help menu should
contain useful data for your aircraft) and that the gear and the arrestor hook are
down.
<!--l. 205--><p class="indent" >   As you approach you should see, on the left hand side of the deck, a set of brightly
coloured lights - called the Fresnel Lens Optical landing System (FLOLS). This indicates
your position on the landing glideslope. You will see a horizontal row of green lights,
and when approximately on the glideslope, an orange light (known in some
circles as the &#8220;meatball&#8221;) approximately in line with the green lights. When
approaching correctly, the meatball appears in line with the green lights. If you are
high it is above, and when low it is below. If you are very low the meatball
turns red. If you fly to keep the meatball aligned you should catch number 3
wire.
<!--l. 213--><p class="indent" >   Carrier landings are often described as &#8220;controlled crashes&#8221; and you shouldn&#8217;t waste
your time attempting to flare and place the aircraft gently on the deck like you would
with a conventional landing - ensuring that you catch the wires is the main
thing.
<!--l. 217--><p class="indent" >   Immediately your wheels touch the deck, you should open the throttles to full power,
in case you have missed the wires and need to &#8220;go around&#8221; again; the wires will hold the
aircraft if you have caught them, even at full power.
<!--l. 221--><p class="indent" >   If you wish, you can then raise the elevators from the ATC/AI menu, taxi onto one
of the elevators, lower it (uncheck the box on the menu) and taxi off into the
hangar.
<!--l. 224--><p class="indent" >   Don&#8217;t be discouraged if you don&#8217;t succeed at first - it&#8217;s not an easy maneouver to
master. If after a little practice you find the Seahawk too easy, you could move on to the
Seafire for more of a challenge!

to 15,000ft. Once cruising at this altitude, select AI/ATC-&#x003E;Tanker, and select
&#8220;Request&#8221;, which will spawn a new tanker in clear air at approximately your
altitude.
<!--l. 514--><p class="indent" >   FlightGear will report the altitude, speed, and TACAN identifier of the tanker.
Program your TACAN with the TACAN identifier reported by the tanker (from the
Equipment-&#x003E;Radio Settings dialog, or your cockpit controls). Depending on your
aircraft, the tanker may also appear on your radar. If you require more help to find the
tanker, you can select &#8220;Get Position&#8221; to be told the tanker location relative to
yourself
<!--l. 521--><p class="indent" >   Turn to an appropriate heading, guided by the TACAN bearing (you should try a
"leading" approach to close in on the tanker) and look for the tanker on the radar or nav.
screen. Around 5nm away, you should reduce your speed to around 20kts faster than the
tanker - a "slow overtake". The KC135 will be visible from about 10nm, the KA6-D,
being smaller, just over 1 nm. If you find yourself overshootng, deploy your
airbrakes.
<!--l. 528--><p class="indent" >   Close to within 50ft of the tanker (don&#8217;t get too close, or you may collide with the
tanker itself). You should see indication in the cockpit that you are receiving fuel - there
is a green light in the A4 fuel gauge, and you should see the indicated tank load
increase.
<!--l. 533--><p class="indent" >   Once your tanks are full, or you have taken as much fuel as you wish, close the
throttle a little, back away from the tanker and continue your intended flight.
<!--l. 537--><p class="indent" >   Successfully refueling is not easy and can take a lot of practise, as in real life. Here
are some helpful hints for making contact.

  class="enumerate" id="x10-114002x1">Approach the tanker slowly. It is very easy to overshoot and be unable to
                                                                     

                                                                     
     spot where the tanker has gone.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x10-114004x2">If  you  are  having  difficulty  matching  the  speed  of  the  tanker  due  to  the
     throttle being too sensitive, try deploying your airbrakes. This will require
     more power to achieve the same speed and will reduce the throttle sensitivity.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x10-114006x3">To  reduce  your  workload,  you  may  be  able  to  use  the  autpilot  to  stay  at
     the correct altitude and/or speed. This is technically cheating, though NASA
     recently demonstrated that an advanced autopilot can perform AAR without
     pilot intervention.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x10-114008x4">Bear in mind that as you receive fuel your aircraft will become heavier and
     the center of gravity will move, affecting the trim of the aircraft.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x10-114010x5">The tanker aircraft fly a clock-wise "race-track" pattern in the sky. While it is
     possible to stay connected during these turns, you may find it easier to wait
     until the tanker has settled on its new course before refueling. The tanker
     aircraft provide warnings when they are intending to turn.</li></ol>

<!--l. 560--><p class="noindent" >Refuelling is possible within a Multiplayer session using the KC135 or Victor. The pilot
of this aircraft should use the callsign "MOBIL1", "MOBIL2" or "MOBIL3". Other
numbers are acceptable, but only these three have A-A TACAN channels assigned. These
are 060X, 061X and 062X respectively.
<!--l. 565--><p class="indent" >   If the receiving aircraft uses a YASim FDM, there are no further complications.
Should the receiving aircraft be JSBSim based, the user must make sure that there are no
AI tankers in their configuration. This means disabling (commenting out) all refuelling
"scenarios" in the relevant aircraft-set.xml and in preferences.xml.
<!--l. 571--><p class="indent" >   MP refuelling works in exactly the same way as AI refuelling and is a fun challenge.
It is best to ensure that your network connection is as free from interruptions as
possible; the MP code does a degree of prediction if there is a "blip" in the
stream of packets and this can make close formation flight very difficult or even
impossible.
