<h1>A Circuit in FlightGear</h1>

<p>I took these screenshots in FlightGear during two right-handed
circuits on runway 22 at CYOW (I would have used only one, but I
managed to crash FlightGear -- the program, not the plane -- during
one of the screenshots on crosswind the first time through).</p>

<p>Often, when people have trouble controlling a plane in a PC
simulator, it's because they're fixating on the panel and chasing the
gauges.  That's the wrong way to fly; here's the right way:</p>

<blockquote><font size="5" color="red">LOOK OUT THE
WINDOW.</font></blockquote>

<p>These pictures show how you can fly smoothly by concentrating on
where the horizon hits the nose of the plane; in other words, by
paying attention to the plane's <strong>attitude</strong>.  You actual
visual references for the horizon may change if you use a different
pilot viewpoint or a different 3D model, but your first step should
always be to learn the attitudes that work for the plane you're flying
and then stick with them, cross-checking the airspeed indicator and
altimeter no more often than you would check your rearview mirror in a
car.</p>


<div>
<h3>1. On the Threshold</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-001.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-001-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>The run-up and pre-takeoff checks are finished and tower has
cleared us onto the runway.  The plane's not moving yet, so all three
wheels are solidly on the ground.  Look closely at the vertical
distance between the top of the white cowling and the horizon.  Right
now, the horizon is between a third and a half way up the windshield,
just like it will be during level cruise on the downwind leg and
during final approach with the flaps down.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>2. Beginning the Takeoff Roll</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-002.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-002-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>When I advance the throttle to full, the plane starts moving down
the runway.  The speed causes the nose to lift slightly on its own,
but the horizon is still between a half and a third of the way up the
windshield.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>3. Raising the Nose</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-003.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-003-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>As the speed increases, I pull back just a <em>little</em> to take
some weight off the nosewheel.  At 55kt, the nose wheel has started to
lift a little off the runway: you can tell, because the horizon is now
touching the bottom of the windshield. I am almost in the climb
attitude.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>4. Liftoff</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-004.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-004-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>At 65kt, the other two wheels leave the runway and the plane is
flying.  Note that I do not yank it off by pulling the yoke way back:
raising the nose only a tiny sliver above the horizon and holding it
there is sufficient to get the plane into the air.  Note where the
horizon strikes the sides of the cowling, just above the top of the
panel.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>5. Climb Attitude</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-005.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-005-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>After I lift off, the plane keeps speeding up: in ground effect,
there is no more friction from the tires but drag is very low.  Since
I want to climb at 70 kt, I have to raise the nose a sliver higher to
keep the airspeed down.  Now, at 100 ft AGL, my plane is in the
<strong>climb attitude</strong>: all of the white cowling is now above
the horizon, and the horizon hits the sides at very top of the panel
itself.  As long as I hold the horizon at this point, the plane will
keep climbing smoothly at 70 kt.</p>

<p>At no point during this entire circuit will it be necessary to
raise the nose any higher than it is right now: the climb attitude is
the highest attitude I'll need to use for regular flight.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>6. Turn to Crosswind</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-006.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-006-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>At 800 ft ASL (400 ft AGL in real life, 500 ft AGL in FlightGear), I
start my turn to crosswind.  Normally, the turn would be to the left,
but runway 22 at CYOW uses a right-handed circuit to keep us out of
the way of the big jets in the south field.</p>

<p>This is where things get a little trickier (but not much).  Because
I'm turning, the horizon is not going to hit the panel in the same
place on both sides.  Instead, I have to imagine where the horizon was
hitting the centre of the panel out of side, and try to keep the
imaginary hidden horizon going through that spot; to do so, I will
have to pull back <em>slightly</em> on the yoke.  It works, and the
plane is still climbing at around 70 kt through the turn with 15 deg
bank (steep turns are a dumb idea at slow speed near the ground).</p>

<p>Before making the actual turn, I looked out my window for two
reasons: to check for traffic, and to choose a target point under my
wing; as long as I turn and fly towards that point, I will have done a
more-or-less 90deg turn.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>7. Crosswind Leg</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-007.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-007-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>The turn to crosswind is finished and my plane is still in the
climb attitude, on its way to a circuit altitude of 1500 ft ASL.
Depending on the wind, the Cessna 172 can usually make circuit
altitude just before the turn to downwind, but if not, I will just
keep climbing through that turn as well.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>8. The Runway from Crosswind</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-008.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-008-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>As my plane climbs in the crosswind leg, I look back over my
shoulder to check where I am relative to the runway.  Normally, you
should not need much distance before your crosswind turn, so the
runway will still be fairly close to the plane.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>9. Turn to Downwind</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-009.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-009-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>I'm almost a mile from the runway, and it's time to do the turn to
downwind.  Again, I pick a spot under my wing and then turn to fly
towards it.  Because I'm reaching circuit altitude at the same time as
my turn, things are getting a little trickier:</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>I have to hold the plane in its bank, keeping the horizon and the
correct angle across the windshield.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I have to push my nose down to the cruise attitude (see below), so
that the plane doesn't climb past circuit altitude of 1500 ft ASL.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I have to pull back the power to a cruise setting once the plane
has accelerated to between 90-100 kt.</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>At first, it might be a good idea to turn earlier or later so that
you can separate the levelling-out from the turning, but it will all
come together with practice.  If you end up gaining or losing a couple
of hundred feet, don't feel bad -- that happens at first in real life
as well.</p>

<p>In any case, the rule for starting or ending a climb is APT:
<strong>Attitude</strong>, <strong>Power</strong>,
<strong>Trim</strong>.  First I push the nose down to increase your
airspeed, <em>then</em> I pull the power back to a cruise power
setting, and finally I use the elevator trim to help hold the plane in
your cruise attitude.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>10. Downwind Leg</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-010.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-010-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>The downwind leg is often the longest part of the circuit.  I have
pulled the power back to 2100rpm and have put the nose into the
<strong>cruise attitude</strong>, where the horizon is between a half
and a third of the way up the windshield, just like it was when the
plane was on the ground.  I cross-check the altimeter to make sure
that I'm not climbing or descending, then make <em>tiny</em>
adjustments to my attitude if necessary, but I do not keep watching
the altimeter while I'm doing that.  It's surprisingly easy to hold
altitude this way, once you get used to it.</p>

<p>As soon as I'm established on downwind, I make a radio call to
tower and get my sequence for landing; I also tell them whether I plan
to make a full stop (they'll assume a touch-and-go if I don't
specify).  Finally, I perform my downwind checks: fuel on both,
mixture rich, carb heat hot (well, not in a C172R), mags on both,
primer locked, brake pressure positive.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>11. The Runway from Downwind</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-011.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-011-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>While I'm flying my downwind, I look out the side to check that I'm
tracking parallel to the runway.  In a strong crosswind, the heading
of the plane will not be parallel to the runway, so I have to watch
whether the runway seems to be getting nearer or farther rather than
staying the same distance.  During this flight, the winds are light
and the runway position is fine.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>12. Time to Turn Base</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-012.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-012-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>Most airports seem to have some convenient building or other
feature right at the turn to base; unfortunately, that particular
feature won't work at any other airport.  Instead, I look over my
shoulder and watch for when the threshold is about a 45 deg angle back
from the plane (I could have turned a little earlier in this example).
As soon as I reach that point, it's time to make a descending turn to
the base leg; until then, I hold the 1500 ft circuit altitude (in the
U.S., I believe that I could begin my descent while still in the
downwind).</p>

<p><em><strong>Alex Perry adds:</strong> I've been recommended to
always pick a point ahead for my base turn, even at unfamiliar
airports, and then crosscheck it with looking over my shoulder.  The
reason for this is it keeps the pilot spending more time looking
forward and watching for conflicting traffic that is joining the
pattern on a discouraged late downwind or base leg entry.</em></p>


<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>13. Turn to Base</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-013.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-013-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>This was the hardest part of the circuit for me to learn.  In
Canada, at least, we are not supposed to descend in the downwind, so
we have to change the airspeed and power, add flaps, set up the
descent, and execute a 90 degree turn all at the same time.  To start
or end a descent, I use the order PAT: Power, Attitude, Trim. This is
where it's good to fly by the numbers: in a calm wind, a power setting
of 1500 rpm usually works well for a 70 kt approach, so I take the
following steps:</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>Reduce power to 1500 rpm.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Initiate a 10-20 deg turn (usually to the left, but in this
circuit, to the right).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>During the turn, pull up the nose until the airspeed is at 70 kt,
then hold that attitude; usually, the attitude will be about half way
between the cruise attitude and the climb attitude before I apply
flaps.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Once the airspeed drops into the white arc, add the first 10 deg
of flaps and adjust the attitude to maintain 70 kt (actually, the first
10 deg are allowed before the white arc).</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>If I do everything right, I come out of the turn onto the base leg
right at 70 kt at a 400 fpm descent, and I can trim as soon as the
wings are level.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>14. Base Leg</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-014.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-014-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>Once I come out of the turn to base, I set the nose into the
attitude that will give me exactly 70 kt (in this case, with the
horizon about a quarter of the way up the windshield), then trim until
I don't need any pressure to hold it there.  There's not much else to
do during base except to look for traffic and to try to judge when to
start the turn to final.  The plane is descending at about 300-400
fpm, but the VSI is not yet ready to register it.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>15. The Runway from Base</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-015.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-015-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>During the base leg, it's important to keep the runway in sight,
but it's also important (in real life) to look the other way in case
anyone else is coming in unannounced on a longer final.  Given my
current speed, this looks like just the right point to begin a gentle
turn to final: it's a hard thing to estimate, and I still get it wrong
often, but it's no big deal to do a gentle S-curve to realign myself
if I turn a bit too late.  The only big mistake would be to do a steep
turn right now.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>16. Turn to Final</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-016.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-016-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>I already trimmed for 70 kt on the turn to base, so this turn is
nice and simple: I just have to pull back on the yoke slightly to keep
the nose from dropping in the turn and raising the airspeed, and I
want to try to turn right onto the extended centreline of the runway.
A steep bank at this point would be a bad idea, since I'm slow and
close to the ground, and have little room to recover from a
stall/spin.  I'm currently 630 ft above the real airport elevation,
and 700 ft above the FlightGear elevation.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>17. Long Final</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-017.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-017-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>The airport is a little less than a mile ahead, and the plane is
500 ft AGL, so the approach looks good: 1500 rpm is bringing me down
nicely, just as it does in a real 172 (if there were a strong
headwind, I'd need a little more power).  I really am descending
faster than the VSI indicates -- it's very sluggish (and should be
ignored on visual approaches); nevertheless, I drop another 10 deg of
flaps to help the approach and push the nose down to maintain my
airspeed.  A good rule to remember is that at the same airspeed the
nose is usually lower with flaps than without.  With 20 degrees of
flaps, my <strong>approach attitude</strong> is almost identical to my
cruise attitude earlier; only the power setting is different.</p>

<p>Now comes the important part.  I pick a point on the runway about a
quarter of the way down (I'd use the threshold if this were a
touch-and-go, since the 172 glides so well), then I try to hold that
point <strong>exactly</strong> a third of the way up the windshield
while maintaining my 70 kt approach speed.  I retrim because of the
flaps, then use small power adjustments rather than elevator to keep
me on the glide path and hold the aim point steady on the windshield.
As long as I hold this current attitude most of the way to the flare,
my airspeed will stay steady.</p>

<p>It is also important to keep the plane over the extended centreline
of the runway.  Right now, it is lined up with the left edge; I can
tell because the left edge of the runway looks perfectly vertical,
while the right edge slows down to the right.  When I am on the
centreline, the edges will appear to slope downwards in opposite
directions.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>18. Approach</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-018.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-018-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>Still on final, about 300 ft AGL, I am in a good position.  My aim
point is still on the same spot on the windshield, and I'm still near
my target approach speed of 70 kt (far enough above stall speed that
the plane won't stall if a gust of wind temporarily slows its
airspeed).  I know that I'm over the extended centerline now, because
the edges of the runway seem to open in opposite directions: one
angles to my left and one to my right.  I drop my last 10 deg of
flaps; the flaps will cause the nose to rise and my airspeed to fall,
so at the same time, I hold the nose down to keep my aim point at the
same spot on the windshield and maintain 70 kt.</p>

<p>If FlightGear had ATC, the tower would call me about now with my
landing clearance.  If I didn't get it, I would have to overshoot and
do the circuit again.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>19. Short Final</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-019.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-019-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>I'm on short final, about 100 ft AGL, with the aim point on the
same spot on the windshield: because I am still using the approach
attitude and power setting, my airspeed is still 70 kt.  It's obvious
that I'm going to make the runway, so it's time to start pulling up
the nose, <strong>very slowly</strong>, to get ready for the flare (in
the U.S., this is called the <em>roundout</em>).  My goal is to have
the nose a little above the cruise attitude by the time the plane is a
foot or two above the runway.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>20. Beginning of Flare</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-020.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-020-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>It's very important not to fly the plane straight onto the runway
or it will bounce.  I already started raising the nose on short final
and managed to reduce my speed from 70 kt to 62 kt.  Right now, as I
start skimming a foot above the runway, the plane is just a little
above the cruise attitude.  I'll try to keep the plane at exactly this
level as long as I can, gradually pulling the nose up to the climb
attitude as the airspeed falls.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>21. Gliding in Ground Effect</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-021.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-021-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>Now it's time to burn off some speed.  The wheels are a little more
than a foot above the runway, but ground effect lets us stay in the
air for quite a while.  Keeping the plane off the runway requires a
higher and higher attitude as the airspeed drops, but don't overdo it:
note that here, at 53 kt, we're about halfway between the cruise
attitude where we started the flare and the climb attitude where we'll
end it.  Fast but small control inputs should keep the plane under
your control.  If there were a strong crosswind, you would also have
to be careful to hold your sideslip.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>22. Touchdown on Main Wheels</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-022.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-022-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>I started the flare at the cruise attitude; now, with the wheels a
few inches above the ground, the plane is just about at the climb
attitude.  At 45 kt, we're still a little fast touching down, but it's
not too bad (and we will lose a couple more knots by touchdown).  As
soon as the wheels touch (or just before, if I'm gliding too far), I
retract the flaps to help keep the wheels more firmly on the
runway.</p>

<p>Note that the attitude is very important at the touchdown.  If you
put the nose too low, the nosewheel will hit first and all kinds of
bad things will happen.  If you raise the nose too high, you may
balloon ten feet up into the air then drop like a stone when the wings
stall.  Make sure that <em>you</em> choose the attitude rather than
letting the plane choose it for you.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>23. Lowering the Nosewheel</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-023.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-023-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>As my speed falls below 40 kt, I gently lower the nosewheel to the
ground.  If I do it too soon, the nosewheel will shimmy; if I do it
too late, it will drop hard when my speed falls low enough.  On a
short field or in strong, gusty winds, however, I lower the nosewheel
quickly and firmly to keep the plane under control on the ground.</p>

<p>Even after lowering the nosewheel, it's a good idea to keep some
back pressure on the yoke so that most of the weight will be on the
main wheels, both to spare the nosewheel and to make the brakes more
effective.  Once the nosewheel is down, I apply the brakes gently
(there's no rush -- the turn-off is still a fair way ahead).</p>

<p>If FlightGear had ATC, the tower would call me about now and tell
me to exit on taxiway Papa then contact ground at 121.9 MHz.</p>

<br />
</div>


<div>
<h3>24. Exiting on Taxiway Papa</h3>

<a href="fgfs-screen-024.jpg">
<img align="right" src="fgfs-screen-024-thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>Once I'm clear of the runway, I stop on taxiway Papa to do my
post-landing checks.  If FlightGear had ATC, I would then call ground
on 121.9 MHZ and request permission to taxi back to the flying club.
I usually taxi a 172 at around 900-1000 rpm, less if there are strong,
gusty winds.</p>
