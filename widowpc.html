<H1>Preconfigured, preloaded, optimized, ultimate FlightGear gaming
PC!</H1>

Order the <EM>fastest</EM> machine in the <EM>gaming computer
industry</EM> preloaded, and preconfigured to run FlightGear at
it's optimal settings.<BR>

<UL>
  <LI> Take the guess work and hassle out of building your next
       ultimate <B>FlightGear</B> and general gaming PC.

  <LI> Get <B>FlightGear</B> (including the entire world scenery set)
       preloaded and optimized on your new PC.

  <LI> Is your current PC showing it's age?  Are you less than
       satisfied with your current FlightGear performance?  You know
       you need to upgrade your PC anyway, so why not take a look at
       the <EM>fastest</EM> and <EM>best!</EM>
</UL>

<H3>Enter WidowPC</H3>

<B>WidowPC</B> is collaborating with FlightGear.org to bring you
their top of the line systems preloaded, preconfigured, and optimized
for FlightGear.  They build the ultimate gaming PC and include the
latest release of FlightGear optimized to run at maximum performance
and maximum display quality for their hardware.
<P>

<B>WidowPC</B> offers some amazing features, service, and support for
all the hardware they sell.  This is no ordinary PC with no ordinary
performance.  Here are some of the features that come standard with a
WidowPC system:

<UL>
  <LI> Only the highest quality components are selected - factoring in
       performance, stability, and longevity.

  <LI> WidowPC offers a "starter" configuration (IX2-FlightGear) and an
       "ultimate" configuration (IX2-FlightGear Pro.)  Don't be fooled by
       names though, the starter system will still blow your socks off.

  <LI> WidowPC has their own custom aircooling design.  Nearly silent and
       more effective than most liquid cooled setups. 

  <LI> Aluminum anodized cases (black) with the FlightGear logo laser
       etched on side.

  <LI> No crappy/junk screws.  Only stainless steel screws with rubber
       washers are used through out the system.  And just to show you
       their level of PC insanity, all screws heads are lined up consistently
       and evenly with a perfect north/south/east/west orientation. 

  <LI> WidowPC has zero tolerance for failure.  Each system is put
       through an extreme amount of bench testing - a minimum of 53-58
       hours.  <EM>No problems or glitches are tolerated!</EM> Parts
       are replaced at the first hint of trouble.

  <LI> WidowPC systems are built around specially made RAM comprised
       of the highest end components for maximal possible
       overclocking.  Every stick is tested and best matched in pairs
       for most compatible performance.

  <LI> There is no skimping on hard drives either.  The primary drive
       and data drive are separate. Raid0 is available for the primary
       system disk.  Raid0 is striping which means your system disk is
       about 85% faster than the already fast single drive.

  <LI> All data drives are mounted in hot swap removable bays (and
       secured with a keylock.)

  <LI> WidowPC engineers perform many advanced customizations and
       tweaks to optimize windows performance

  <LI> The very last thing done to a system before shipping it to the
       customer is creating a complete restore image from your drive.
       This means your restore image is easy to use and includes all
       license keys, configuration changes, and optimizations made to
       the original system you receive.

  <LI> WidowPC systems ship with a spec sheet detailing optimal
       graphics settings for optimal FlightGear performance.  If you
       upgrade any component or install new drivers and need to
       restore your optimal system settings, these are provided to
       you.

  <LI> Ships with  Windows XP Professional.

  <LI> World class service and support.  If you have any questions
       about these systems or have any problems with a machine you
       have purchased?  They offer 24-7 online and telephone
       assistance.
