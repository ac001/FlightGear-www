<H1>John Wojnaroski's 747 Project</H1>

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>

Two years ago Curtis posted a query to see if anyone was interested in
developing glass displays for FlightGear based on the OpenGC
project. One thing led to another and after developing some early
software (<A HREF="http://www.opengc.org">http://www.opengc.org</A>)
and meeting with Jim Brennan and several months browsing websites of
sim developers and cockpit builders I decided to take it one step
further and build some hardware.  <P>

Curtis has graciously offered the services and resources of the
FlightGear website to publish the results of the project and on-going
progress towards a fully functional system.  Here is an initial, brief
description of a work in progress to build a functional flight
simulator with a cluster of Linux based PCs.
<P>


<H3>FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION</H3>

The preliminary design consists of four PCs connected with a LAN,
display monitors, and a prototype interface board for driving LED
displays and reading the wide variety of switches and controls that
populate a modern flightdeck.
<P>

The Captain's PC (CAP_PC) operates the left joystick,
captain's primary displays, standby instruments, primary
EICAS, and left FMC #1 . The First Officer's PC (FO_PC)
operates the first officers primary displays, secondary EICAS, right
joystick, throttles, and right FMC #2. The MCDU PC (MCDU_PC) operates
the MCDU displays, FMC #3 and provides the primary interface to the
cockpit hardware. It also serves as the network center or master
controller and interface to the FlightGear PC (FG_PC) that provides
all the scenery and flight dynamics and out-the-window view.
<P>

The network is built around the FlightGear options for sending state
data to the display machines and receiving control data from the
flightdeck to activate aircraft systems, avionics, flight controls,
and throttles.

<H3>GLARESHIELD DESCRIPTION</H3>

The row of switches and panels located above the displays provide for
aircrew control and selection of a variety of display modes,
navigation and system data, and data entry to the autopilot systems. A
good description of flightdecks and glass displays is available at <A
REF="http://www.meriweather.com/flightdeck.html">http://www.meriweather.com/flightdeck.html</A>
<P>

The panels were provided by Advanced Graphics Technologies <A
HREF="http://www.aircraftsimulators.com">http://www.aircraftsimulators.com</A>
and the electronics provide for interfacing 48 momentary switches, 128
static switches, and six rotary encoders, plus the drivers for 16
7-segment LEDs. The interface to the PC is via a parallel port and an
interrupt driven linux device driver.

<H3>Scale 3X (Los Angeles, CA; Feb 12-13, 2005)</H3>

Jack, Jim, and Curt dismantled the sim and carted it down to the Scale 3X expo
at the Los Angeles convention center.  Here are a few pictures from the event:

Harold Johnson, who gave his permission to post his interview here:

Here is a movie of Jack's simulator in action (note until someone converts
this to mpg or avi, it will most likely require a recent windows media player
to view):
