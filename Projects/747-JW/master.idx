<H1>John Wojnaroski's 747 Project</H1>

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>

Two years ago Curtis posted a query to see if anyone was interested in
developing glass displays for FlightGear based on the OpenGC
project. One thing led to another and after developing some early
software (<A HREF="http://www.opengc.org">http://www.opengc.org</A>)
and meeting with Jim Brennan and several months browsing websites of
sim developers and cockpit builders I decided to take it one step
further and build some hardware.  <P>

Curtis has graciously offered the services and resources of the
FlightGear website to publish the results of the project and on-going
progress towards a fully functional system.  Here is an initial, brief
description of a work in progress to build a functional flight
simulator with a cluster of Linux based PCs.
<P>


<H3>FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION</H3>

The preliminary design consists of four PCs connected with a LAN,
display monitors, and a prototype interface board for driving LED
displays and reading the wide variety of switches and controls that
populate a modern flightdeck.
<P>

The Captain's PC (CAP_PC) operates the left joystick,
captain's primary displays, standby instruments, primary
EICAS, and left FMC #1 . The First Officer's PC (FO_PC)
operates the first officers primary displays, secondary EICAS, right
joystick, throttles, and right FMC #2. The MCDU PC (MCDU_PC) operates
the MCDU displays, FMC #3 and provides the primary interface to the
cockpit hardware. It also serves as the network center or master
controller and interface to the FlightGear PC (FG_PC) that provides
all the scenery and flight dynamics and out-the-window view.
<P>

The network is built around the FlightGear options for sending state
data to the display machines and receiving control data from the
flightdeck to activate aircraft systems, avionics, flight controls,
and throttles.

<H3>GLARESHIELD DESCRIPTION</H3>

The row of switches and panels located above the displays provide for
aircrew control and selection of a variety of display modes,
navigation and system data, and data entry to the autopilot systems. A
good description of flightdecks and glass displays is available at <A
REF="http://www.meriweather.com/flightdeck.html">http://www.meriweather.com/flightdeck.html</A>
<P>

The panels were provided by Advanced Graphics Technologies <A
HREF="http://www.aircraftsimulators.com">http://www.aircraftsimulators.com</A>
and the electronics provide for interfacing 48 momentary switches, 128
static switches, and six rotary encoders, plus the drivers for 16
7-segment LEDs. The interface to the PC is via a parallel port and an
interrupt driven linux device driver.

<H3>2004 PLANS</H3>

Complete fabrication of the main display overlay panels and
installation of gear panel, master caution lights, and red/white flood
lights
<P>

Install digital projection system for center screen.
<P>

Complete fabrication of center console with throttle/flap assembly and
radio/nav panels
<P>

Procure or fabricate MCDU faceplates and build electronics to
interface panel keys
<P>

Continue software development and models for fuel, electrical,
hydraulic, etc systems
  

<H3>2005 PLANS</H3>

More software development
<P>

Left and right digital projection screens and supporting PCs
<P>

Design refinement as time and budget warrant
<P>

Continue the scavenge hunt for spare parts and equipment


<H3>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</H3>

Special thanks to the following for their time and support:
<P>

Curtis Olson, who provided assistance and help in my understanding of
the FlightGear architecture and C++
<P>

Jim Brennan, who provided volumes of data, manuals, and information on
the 747 and its systems
<P>

Damion Shelton, the author of OpenGC, for his critique and assistance
in the early development of the display software
<P>

Mark Harris, for the sophisticated and elegant 3D cloud software,
I'm still trying to fully comprehend,
<P>

David Culp, who provided information on current cockpit procedures
required to execute instrument approaches and engine start sequences,
and finally
<P>

The FlightGear community and user groups for providing a wealth of
ideas, discussions, and opinions through their emails on every aspect
of computer modeling.
