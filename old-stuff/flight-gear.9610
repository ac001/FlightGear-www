FG Development team...

Well, after a week long crash, I have my computer semi-operational 
again.  It is damaged and I have lost some of the material I was going 
to post to the list for consideration.

Here is what I am working on...

1)  Formal specs

I think we should seriously start specing out the various subsystems 
(kernel, database, aircraft models, ATC, etc).  One thing I really don't 
want to do is rewrite code.  The stronger our base foundation, the 
easier a time we will have in writing this.  We need to resolve baseline 
platform issues (screen resolutions, primitive graphics) above all else, 
in my opinion.  Things like what type of math for graphics math (fixed 
or floating point), memory and processor targets, issues unique to 
windowed OS's, and so on.  We need to start building some tools for our 
primitive data types and get some crude operational code together, even 
if it isn't portable, so we can see how things will fit. 

I'm getting a bad feeling about getting too deep into the low level 
stuff right now.  I think we should be working high level for the moment 
and take it downward when we start see how this program is going to fit 
together.

I have a reason for this view.  Eric has done some wonderful work.  (I 
have barely starting coding, I basically have a maximized window with 
the caption "Flight Gear").  I am really pushing the Bombardier 
connection and I would like something to materialize there.  If they 
want to see more, I would like to send them some working code so they 
have some visuals.  It will help show that we are working.

Just some thoughts on the issue.  I am currently drafting a detailed FG 
overview to give us a firmer framework to look at.  A copy is going to 
Bombardier, and I will post it here for review.  

2)  Bombardier

I spoke with Francine Blackburn at Bombardier Canada.  She was pleased 
to hear from me.  I have sent her all available info on FG, including 
excerpts from our mailing list and a letter detailing our goals and 
requirements, as well as request for any assistance.  If we can build 
relationships here, it will go a long way in helping us get off the 
ground, as it were.  :)

I will keep you posted.  (And if I go to Montreal, yes, I will take 
pictures.  :)

3)  Win32 prototype

I have a window, folks.  I am plowing through my graphics programming 
books and sticking together a system for generating views.  Expect to 
see the first inklings of the ODL here.  If I can get a cube on the 
screen from a scenery file, it will be a start.  I will co-ordinate with 
Eric on that so we can begin to get something going here.

The way I see things, Eric is working bottom up, I am working top down. 
 We'll meet in the middle somewhere.  :)

4)  General comments

Love your ideas, Curt.  Let's subdivide the world.  Build a simple 
database showing what regions cover what areas of Long/Lat, then we can 
forget about co-ordinate problems and do the world flat regions joined 
together.  I also want to hear ideas on weather here, for haze effects, 
etc.  (Do we want raindrops splattering on the windscreen?  I do.  :)

To the aero-modellers:  Think about how you want to "assemble" aircraft. 
 What kind of detail, flight handling characteristics, etc.  I would 
love a tool where we can design aircraft by dragging pieces together in 
3D and let the program work out the flight model, which we can then 
tweak.  :)

5)  Final comment

Yes, folks, I am quite excited about this project.  :)

Take care, one and all,

Matt

Before I get into Matt's message, a status report.  I finally got around to 
adding some minimal palette support.  The first 16 colors in the palette
are going to be the "standard" 16 color VGA colors.  I also wrote two drivers
one to display random lines (10 per second) and one to display color bars.  
So far they work under OS/2 and DJGPP.  (Yes! real stuff on the screen) I'll be 
trying it out on X tonight and will put the modified code on my web site.

I'm having problems getting the code to port to compilers without a
64 bit integral type.  I think I'm going to "typedef FG_INT64 double;"
on those machines.  We'll lose some precision, but it should be OK.
As far as fixed versus fp, I think that should be a compile time
decision.  I've written a program "fp_test" to determine the fastest
way of doing various operations.  For the machines I've tried 
(Pentium, SPARC), integer is fastest for add and subtract, but 
float is fastest for multiply and divide.  So what's happening is I've defined 
macros in "fgfixed.h" for the various operations.  They are of the form
F_ADD(x,y), F_ADD64(x,y), F_SUB(x,y), etc.

Send your code so I can look at it and see how thing can fit together.

Hi Eric,

Would it be possible to include a compiled version of this
program on your website as well? I don't have DJGPP and so I
can't compile it to see what's going on. :) 

Thanks and regards,

After looking at scenery design proposals for FGFS, I decided to express
my opinion on the subject.


In the discussions about bits and bytes we should not forget one of the
most important features of FGFS (maybe the most important one) -
compatibility.

The compatibility of scenery data is needed between different platforms,
between different versions of FG (upwards/downwards) and between
sceneries produced by different scenery design tools. By different
platforms I also mean different FG implementations for one hardware
platform. We can even view MSFS as one of the platforms.

We need to develop a file format for DISTRIBUTING and STORING sceneries
that would ensure every scenery can be used with every implementation of
FG. In particular, it should meet following criteria:

Upward compatibility. The scenery data should be usable on all future FG
versions. Where possible, the scenery should gain new features and
functionality added to future versions of FG.

Downward compatibility. The scenery data should be usable on all
previous versions of FG. Where necessary, the scenery should lose
features and functionality not available in these versions.

Compatibility across platforms. The scenery data should be usable on all
platforms supporting FG. Where possible, the scenery should gain new
features and functionality available on the target platform. Where
needed, it should be stripped down.

Extensibility. We cannot predict today, which scenery features will be
desired in the future. The scenery file format should be open to
extensions.

Decentralism. Developers of different FG implementations and scenery
design tools should have as much freedom as possible when determining
relevant file formats.


IMHO, it is impossible to develop a single scenery file format that
would meet these criteria. The solution could be to use different file
formats for distributing sceneries and for storing scenery data actually
accessed by FG. Conversions between these formats should be done by
automatic converters.

Different 'levels' of scenery file formats would be needed. The lowest
level would be scenery data actually accessed during the flight. This
format would be highly optimized for the target platform and the
implementation of FG. Here, "tricks" like splitting the world into flat
regions should be used. This format does not need to be compatible with
other FG versions or platforms, so there is a great freedom for
optimizations. Sceneries should NEVER be designed in this format.

The next level ("Mid-Level") would be some file format understood by all
FG implementations. This compatibility, however, should not act as a
restricting factor for it's features. For this reason, different (not
necessarily compatible) versions of this file format can be defined.
Sceneries should NEVER be designed in this format.

There should be some minimal mid-level format understood by all FG
implementations. Each implementation MUST provide a converter from the
minimal format into it's low-level format and MAY also provide
additional converters from more sophisticated mid-level formats.

The next level ("High-Level") would be file formats produced by scenery
design tools and actually used to distribute sceneries. Each scenery
design tool MUST provide a converter for converting it's scenery files
into the minimal mid-level format and MAY also provide additional
converters for more sophisticated mid-level formats.

These rules ensure that ANY high-level scenery file format can be
converted into ANY low-level format.


As an illustration, let's consider a following scenario. We have some
scenery design tool ("PEAK") that produces mountains and the first
version of FG ("FG1") that can display only plain polygons. We design a
mountain "covered with a forest".

PEAK supports only the minimal mid-level scenery file format ("SF1"),
which only allows defining plain polygons. PEAK includes a converter
("PEAK2SF1") that converts out scenery into SF1. FG1 includes a
converter ("SF1TOFG1") that finally converts the SF1 file into the
low-level format used by FG1. We get a plain green mountain.

Later, a Mac version of FG1 ("FG1MAC") is released, which uses a
different low-level format due to a different byte order. However, it
includes it's own converter which converts the SF1 file into it's
low-level format.

Later, a second version of FG ("FG2") is released, which now allows
texture-mapped polygons. It defines a new mid-level scenery file format
("SF2") that allows defining textured polygons. However, it still
contains (it MUST - see the rules) a converter from SF1 ("SF1TOFG2"),
which converts our SF1 file into it's low-level format. However, the
mountain appears non-textured, because SF1 does not support textures and
a converter from PEAK into SF2 is not available yet.

Later, a new version of PEAK is released that supports textures. It also
includes a second converter ("PEAK2SF2") which can convert files into
SF2. The user of our scenery downloads PEAK 2 and uses PEAK2SF2 to get a
file in SF2. Then, he uses the converter supplied with FG2 to convert
SF2 into the low-level format. Now he has a textured mountain, although
the original author of the scenery never thought of such a possibility.

Later, an SGI version of FG ("FGS") is released, which supports fractal
trees. It defines another mid-level scenery file format ("SF3") that
supports fractals. However, it includes low-level converters only from
SF1 (required) and SF3. Because PEAK does not support SF3 at this time,
the user has no other choice but to convert it into SF1 and get a plain
non-textured mountain. The scenery lost one of it's features (texture)
because it was necessary.

Later, a 3rd version of PEAK is released, which includes a converter to
SF3. The user of our scenery downloads PEAK 3, uses PEAK2SF3 to get
fractal trees in the mid-level scenery and uses the converter supplied
with FGS ("SF3TOFGS") to convert it into low-level. He sees a beautiful
mountain covered with fractal trees and decides to design some mountain
scenery himself.

Although designed on and for an SGI, his scenery is compatible to all
versions of FG. For example, a user of FG1 can use a "PEAK2SF1"
converter (which MUST exist - see the rules) and then "SF1TOFG1". Of
course, the mountain will look much worse than it was on an SGI, but it
will still be there.

Later, some FS5 fanatic decides to make FS5 FG-compatible. He writes
converters from SF1 (he MUST do it) and SF2 into the BGL file format.
Now all FG scenery can also run on FS5.

Later, he buys himself an SGI workstation and throws his FS5 away.
However, he misses some great ScBuilt scenery of his home state. So he
writes converters from BGL into SF1 (he MUST do it) and into SF2.

Now it is possible to use all FS5 sceneries with FG and all FG sceneries
with FS5. Note that here FS5 is treated both as a design tool (where BGL
files come from) and as a target platform (where BGL files run on).

Also, sceneries gained or lost some features depending from the actual
FG implementation without _any_ action from scenery authors.

...Now let's go back into the real world


The low-level format should be determined only by programmers of an
actual implementation of FG. It's main purpose is to store scenery data
in a way that could be accessed by the FG implementation in a very
effecient way.

The mid-level format can theoretically be defined by everyone. However,
because a new mid-level format only makes sense if a (in future) large
number of converters is developed, much cooperation and careful thinking
is required here in order to reduce the needed amount of efforts.

For a minimum mid-level format, I would suggest a set of polygons having
solid colors and defined using _real-world_ coordinates. No hidden
surface removal or optimization allowed here - it will be done by a
converter into the low-level format and will highly depend from the
actual hardware used.

The main purpose of the mid-level file format is to allow independent
development of scenery design tools and FG implementations by splitting
the conversion process into two non-overlapping parts.

The high-level format should be determined only by the author of the
corresponding scenery design tool. It's main purpose is to store
sceneries that would automatically enhance themselves with new versions
of FG or scenery design tools. Such enhancements would be made possible
by new coverters supplied with FG or these tools.


Mid-level and high-level formats should be as compatible across
different platforms as possible. I think plain ASCII text files should
be used here. Also, we shouldn't put any artifical restrictions, like
that on the precision of lat/lon coordinates. They will be chopped down
to the precision actually used by the FG implementation during the
conversion process. IMO, the proposed precision of 1 meter is totally
unacceptable. It would even not allow to display the aircraft correctly.
Also, intermediate points at lines, polygons etc. require a much greater
precision than that of geographic data used.


Another important function of converters would be resolving scenery
conflicts. While some FG versions may be clever enough to do this
automatically, we cannot rely on this. Also, it may be better for
performance reasons to resolve scenery conflicts at the conversion time.
Scenery conflicts will have to be resolved during the conversion from
the mid-level into the low-level format, because scenery design tools do
not understand scenery file formats from other tools.

Resolving scenery conflicts could be done in a variety of ways - by
deleting duplicate objects, terrain and navaids from other sceneries, by
including some information about 'exclusion zones', or maybe doing
nothing, assuming the implementation of FGFS is clever enough to resolve
conflicts at run-time.


Converters from high-level into mid-level format should be portable
across all FG platforms. This should not be a big problem, because such
converters would normally not use any hardware/OS-specific functions.
This also means their source code must be publicly available. 


While all these conversions seem to be too complicated to be done by 
ordinary users, they can be automated. FG could automatically determine,
which converters are available and execute them without any interaction
with the user. Also, the user could 'customize' FGFS by determining
different ways of conversion.

Pre-processing scenery data before using the scenery would make FGFS
less flexible in terms of scenery management than, say, MSFS. In the
worst case, the whole scenery database would have to be re-generated
each time a scenery package is installed or remove. However, I think the
achieved compatibility of scenery data would justify this price.


Distributing scenery files in a high-level format would create
additional non-technical problems. For example, some scenery designers
may feel uncomfortable about releasing what basically is their source
code. Maybe some mechanisms could be introduced to prevent 'stealing' of
the scenery, but IMO it is not the top priority now.


We can learn a lot from errors we (and not Microsoft, BTW) made with
MSFS. 

Almost all MSFS sceneries are distributed in the lowest-level format -
as BGL files. When a small bug (I think it was something with magvar) in
the Airport program was discovered, scenery authors had to recompile all
sceneries and upload new versions in order to get it fixed. For this
reasons, lots of scenery files still contain this bug.

Had the authors uploaded their Airport source files instead of BGL files
and tell the users to convert them into BGLs, the problem would become
non-existent as soon as a new (bug-fixed) converter would be uploaded.

When FS5.1 was introduced, lots of problems appeared because of synth
mountain heights. Had scenery authors uploaded their source files, all
synth mountains IN ALREADY RELEASED SCENERIES could be fixed simply by
releasing updated versions of scenery compilers.

This shows how important it is to distribute sceneries in the
highest-possible-level format.

Also, many problems were caused by a changed elevation of the ground
scenery. It would be very easy to write a converter that would adjust
heights of runways etc. to match the new world scenery - it would not
even require the source code for the scenery. However, no one bothered
to do that. Thousands of man-hours were put into manually fixing the
sceneries for FS5.1 instead. Had this effort been spent onto designing
new areas or enhancing existing sceneries (as opposed to fixing), we
would have much more good scenery for MSFS now!

These are only a few examples out of many.

IMO, we created most compatibility problems between FS5.0 and 5.1
ourselves, and now the same thing will probably happen between FS5.1 and
FSFW95. Microsoft programmers simply did their job - enhancing MSFS.
Enhancing _any_ software product creates compatibility problems, so we
shouldn't blame Microsoft for them. We could easily avoid most of the
problems if we would have looked a bit more into the future.

It is very important not to repeat the same errors in FGFS.


A good starting point in FGFS scenery design could be (even if this
sounds strange) developing a converter into the BGL file format used by
MSFS and developing some high-level scenery design tools. This would
allow designing sceneries that could already be used with MSFS, but
would be compatible with FGFS or other flight simulators, should
converters for them exist. Should some implementation of FGFS become a
reality, it would probably be a good idea to develop a converter _from_
BGL files into the mid-level format used by FGFS. This would allow using
(most of) existing MSFS sceneries without having to re-design them from
scratch again. Of course, these sceneries would not be as good as
high-level sceneries specially developed for FGFS, because they would
not enhance themselves with new versions of FG. But they would build a
solid scenery base for the beginning.


Maybe a similar approach could also be made to other components of FG,
such as aircraft, panels etc.

Any opinions?

Group,

Just an idea that popped into my head, would it be best to have a common
scenery scripting language that could be interpreted by scenery compilers
for each platform that FGFS runs on. These source codes could become the
distributable versions.

This is a very abstract idea, but I'm a novice when it comes to scenery
design. Just food for thought.

Dean

Sure.  I'm having some problems with my home link so the upload is going
very slowly.  There will be 3 files, fltgear.zip is the source code.
fgdj.zip is the DOS/DJGPP executable, fgos2.zip is the OS/2 executable.

> PS... what your web page URL?

http://www.cea.berkeley.edu/~korpela/fltgear

It's not pretty, but it does the job.  :)

I should mention that in the current incarnation the DJGPP version is trying
to write to the stdout and stderrand that garbages up the screen.  If you
use 4dos, you can redirect both stdout and stderr by using the command line
"fgmain >& NUL:"  If you don't use 4dos, you can use the redir program that I've
packaged in fgdj.zip  "redir fgmain"

I also forgot to mention that you'll need to get the file fltgear.ini.
I't a text file that contains the window parameters for the drivers.
Eventually I'm going to add video mode selection/window size to the
fltgear.ini file.  Right now it's hardwired to 640x480x8, which may put
some of you out.

I agree, we need to put some thought into how all the pieces will fit
together.

Bottom up vs. Top down is always an issue.  Fortunately, we have more
than one person working on the project so we can attack it from both
directions.

This sounds like it is a great contact.  Maybe we could work out a
deal if they are willing to help with development, we could throw
their logo up on the startup screen someplace.  Then when their
marketing people ship out information and videos on their various
products they could also ship a free cdrom with a simulation of the
various Bombardier aircraft included.  It would be kind of a neat
thing assuming nobody gets all practiced up in our simulator and just
assumes they can hop in one of their planes and go.  (Although if
someone was that stupid they most likely would have offed themselves
long ago.)

Eric,

I got this to compile and run under Linux with one minor tweak to
fgpalet.h ... I added a missing semicolon ";" to the end of line 23.
(Oh, and I had to tweak a couple of things in makefile.linux).  Other
than that it looks great.

Thanks,

Curt.

Dean,

I would tend to agree with you.  We should come up with a scenery
scripting language.  Depending on how we design things, it could/might
look remarkably like one of the existing FS5 scenery compiler
languages.

I think it would be a very good thing for Flight Gear if we could take
advantage of all the existing FS5 scenery.  One way to do this (*if we
had the authors permission*) would be to run the scenery through a
.bgl de-compiler, and then recompile it into Flight Gear scenery.
This would allow us to get around the machine dependencies of the .bgl
format.

Finally, I believe all Flight Gear scenery should be distributed (or
at least available) in "source code" form.  Again this would allow us
to "compile" it for any platform.  It would be a little contrary to
the DOS world's way of releasing binaries only and protecting the
source, but it would fit right in with the Unix/Gnu philosophy of
making the code available.  After all, we are making the source code
to Flight Gear itself freely available.  One advantage to doing this
is that others can come along and improve the scenery for an area if
they like.  In the same way, others can come along and improve the
actual flight gear code if they like.

[oops, I'm going to get a little political here.]

I believe this open nature is at the heart of what will make Flight Gear
successful.  Because anyone has access to the code, we can draw on the
talents, skills, and abilities of people all over the world.  If we
restrict access to the code we only limit our potential.  This is why
commercial flight simulators (while very good) will eventually come in
second place to Flight Gear.  

Time will tell.

Well, off to go play some more "Pick-up Sticks" with the latest Flight
Gear code. :-)

Curt.

I finally had time to spend 5 minutes getting the X version working.
It appears to work OK, but it really needs shared memory support.
(Working over the network is dog slow. A couple frames/second over
local ethernet.)  If you don't have MITSHM support, you'll need to 
undefine MITSHM in fgscreen.c until I get the command line options working.

The next thing on my agenda is to add some keyboard support.  The DOS
users would probably like a way to exit, too :).  Following that I'll
expand the pallete support beyond the minimal colors.  

Anyone have a good color management routine?

Dear Flight Gear Development Team,

after following your effort with pure sympathy for some time
I wanted to try out the initial code. I fetched the
DJGPP binaries and the ini file from E. Korpela's site and 
installed them on my Pentium/Win95 system. Under win95 I got
nothing (DOS shell only which immediately died.) 
Maybe, this was to be expected. I tried booting to clean DOS7. 
This time I got the message "No DPMI". Same error on another
system with pure DOS6.2.

I know, this is NOT a flight simulator at this stage. I simply
want to help by testing the initial code and, maybe, give some
hints. I can estimate that it will not run under win95 at this stage,
but under DOS6? 

Could someone give me a hand in writing a few lines what has to be
done for getting the best running?

I regret that I'm not a developer myself. If there is continuing
work on flight gear the only I can do is testing and perhaps writing 
some (high-language level) documentation later.

One more idea where I might be able to volunteer at this point:
If the developers give me a short description what to do 
for getting the binaries running I would be willing to make a small 
Word document. This could include the goal of the project (info from the 
home page + developer's list), perhaps a few nice pictures and a 
step-by-step instruction.
Eric could add this to the code then, if he finds that it's good,
or at least not bad). I think, such a document would be good to get
more advertising, more people involved from the beginning and,
perhaps by chance even one or another good developer on board.

Justin,

This sounds like a good idea.  I'm not sure how it could be fairly and
practically implemented, but I do like the idea and I think it is
worth looking into in greater depth.

You mention Flight Gear which is why your message caught my eye,
however if something like this were to be set up, I believe it should
encompass all free [civilian?] flight-sim developers who wish to
participate and should *not* be limited to a specific program or
platform.

I was going to write a couple more paragraphs here, but I realize that
I would just be echoing what you said above, so I will just summarize:

    1.  This will provide those stinkin' thieves with a little honest
        competition.
    2.  It will help to bring your "product" to more users.
    3.  It will help cover/defer/make bearable the costs of the
        developers efforts.
    4.  Will help encourage and speed development of cool new stuff.

I have been thinking along related topics in the context of the Flight
Gear project.  There would be several challanges to address:

    1.  How would the money be divided up in a fair way between such a
        wide variety of developers?

        My lovely wife had the following suggestion.  Create a couple
        of categories of developers (such as 3).  If you designed
        scenery for many countries, or created a whole fleet of aircraft from
        scratch, you would most likely end up in the top category.  If
        you designed scenery for a medium size area, or just do a lot
        of quality Microsoft bashing you would end up in the middle
        category.  If you just did scenery for some small airport, or
        repainted the 747, you might end up in the bottom category.
        We could split 50% of the proceeds among the top
        developers, 35% among the middle level developers, and 15%
        among the bottom level developers.

        Of course we would have to clearly define the rules for
        assigning people to categories.  We would also have to discuss
        the proper percentage breakdown for the different classes of
        developers. 

    2.  Would it be realistic to see our cd show up in the local
        comp-usa any time soon?

    3.  There are a number of good mail order cd-rom places that
        specialize in distributing freeware.  It might be possible to
        hook up with something like that to take advantage of their
        distribution channels.

    4.  Most of the 3rd party development has been given away for
        free.  This scheme works well many nice dynamics.  Will
        injecting money in the equation spoil things for
        everyone.  I think the developers should realize that they
        won't get rich from this anyways, and still maintain a 
        "for free" attitude.

    5.  I believe, that even if our products are placed on our CD, we
        should still continue to make everything freely downloadable
        as it currently is.

        I don't think we should include any shareware, or commercial
        demos.  If we do include shareware, the shareware authors
        should probably not be included in the money disbursement.

We should also accept donations.  I can think of several ways in which
a project like Flight Gear (http://www.menet.umn.edu/~clolson/fgfs)
could benifit commercial aviation companies.

For instance, lets say I am the manufacturer of some really cool new
GPS with tons of bells and whistles.  If this new instrument was
modelled in Flight Gear, then I (the company) could send a copy of
Flight Gear on cd along with a nice color brochure and video tape to
prospective customers.  The customer could then pop the cd into his
computer and take the the GPS gizmo on a test drive from his favorite
airport in his favorite plane.

Or, maybe I'm trying to sell kits for a homebuilt aircraft ... this
would be a great try before you buy marketing tool.  Try out the plane
in simulation and see how it performs.  So after 100 tries, you
finally landed the simulator without crashing ... you are all set to
hop in the real thing and go for it ... :-) ... just kidding.

Since flight gear will have an open multi-platform architecture and
source code will be available, it should be fairly straightforward for
a company to model whatever they are trying to sell.

How much would something like this be worth to a company?  Would it
significantly help sales?  I think it could for many products.  If a
company were allowed to ship out CD's of flight-gear (and other flight
sim tools scenery, panels, aircraft, sounds, etc.), they could
negotiate a nice contribution to our non-profit organization.


The more I think about it, the more I feel that this is a great idea
who's time is long over due.  Why not officially join forces for the
benifit of everyone?  All you people out there who are taking
advantage of tons of free scenery, planes, add on utilities, etc.,
wouldn't it be worth it to have them all on one cd in one spot so you
don't have to waste hours and hours finding and downloading them?

Ok, this message is long enough for now.  Now all we need is somebody
who knows something about setting up non-profit organizations, and
some developers to sign on!  Count me in, I could handle $10, I just
won't buy my dog a rawhide bone this week.

Later,

Curt.

You might need to be running full screen DOS in order for the binary to
work properly.

The binary requires a DPMI server (such as Windows, CWSDPMI.exe or
QDPMI.exe)  I'll put CWSDPMI at my Web page.  If you put it into the
flight gear directory it should run under plain dos.

Eric

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a status update for everyone.  I'm in the process of adding keyboard
support and a couple of bitmapped fonts to the program.  I've gotten
keyboard support working on X and will spend today working on OS/2 and
DJGPP.  I've added an analogue of handle_fgevent() called
handle_fgkey_event() that will look for the event in the "fgkeymap.ini"
file and prompt for a key to map it to if the event is not found.
I'm in the process of deciding how to handle these dialogs in a platform
independant way.

I've also gotten a question from someone on how to handle 24 bit color.
I'd like some input, although I won't get to that for a while.  Right now
I'm leaning toward 24 bit color being a compile time option.  Having it
be a run time option would slow the graphics routines a bit unless I added
pointers to the graphics primative functions in the bitmap structure.

I'll keep you updated on my progress.

Eric

Subject: Another status report
Sender: owner-flight-gear
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: flight-gear@infoplane.com

I have the urge to write some sort of summary/status report so here we
go.


1. Eric's efforts.  

Eric has been doing a wonderful job of creating the building blocks
for Flight Gear.  He has been crafting all the low level routines that
will form the foundation of Flight Gear.  He has been hard at work and
many of the pieces are starting to fit together.  Have a look at the
initial code at his web site if you haven't already:

    http://www.cea.berkeley.edu/~korpela/html/

We owe you a few beers. :-)


2. The Flight Gear Web page

I have done a little work this weekend updating the content of the FG
web page (http://www.menet.umn.edu/~clolson/fgfs/).  Specifically I
have created a sub-page that lists what I know about the status of the
various sections of this project.  I encourage everyone to have a look
at the FG web page and let me know if you have any updates or
corrections to make.

If you see yourself fitting into any of the various sub projects, let
me know and I can add your name to the appropriate spots.


3. Non-profit Organization

There has been some discussion on the Flight-Sim@grove.iup.edu mailing
list about possibly setting up a non-profit organization.  Any
freeware flight-sim developers would be welcomed to join the
organization.  They would create cdrom collections of the various free
ware flight sim products created by the member developers.  The
motiviations for doing this are:

    - Help combat the growing trend of people stealing and selling the
      developers hard work.

    - Provide an increased market and larger distrubution for these
      products.

    - Provide a small income in the form of grants to help defer the
      developer's costs of purchasing resources.

    - Promote and encourage additional freeware development.

Note:  All the products on the cdrom would still be available for free
downloading from the internet as before.

It seems that if this organization is created, it might make sense for
us to join.  People are just talking right now, but it is something
that might be worthwhile paying attention to.


4. Future Flight Gear Road Map

Eric's work has been coming along very nicely.  He has written several
simple demo modules to test and demonstrate his code.  All those who
are serious about contributing the the Flight Gear effort might want
to start looking at the code and the example modules.  I think we are
to the point where we might be able to begin working on some of the
other sections of code in parallel.

For example (and these are just random things off the top of my head)
people could start looking at:

    - Finding/recording various engine sounds and other sound effects
    - Building flight model(s).
    - etc.

It might be too early to really start cranking on the various pieces,
but I think we are to the point where we could start looking into some
of these things.


Well, my dog is insisting that I take him for a run, so that's all for
now. 

Curt.

Dear Group,

as an update to my recent report:

I got the flightgear binaries running under win95(!)
in the mean time (full screen, of course).
My problem was with the .ini file. First, I had the
one from E. Korpela's root dir with obviously two lines missing.
Later, I got the stuff C. Olson had copied
(fgdjg.zip and fltgear.zip) and this did what it
was suppose to do (draw random lines on
the screen and some colored stripes). I can
already see the fligh simulator behind this...
A special thank to Eric for this effort.

I think it would be nice to have some (preliminary)
documentation of this code to say people
what it's supposed to do, how to handle it and
a bit more. If no one else wants to do this
and the developers think it does make sense I would like
to do this. Two remarks:

1) I'm not a programmer. I would be glad to have some short
infon, for instance on the numbers in the ini file etc.
I could add more on the project taking material from
C. Olsons Home Page as well as the initial proposals
(only in short) Perhaps a few pictures to get people 
excited about the program including a screen shot showing
what it actually does.

2) Independent on the question who writes the doc I would
propose preparing it in LateX and converting it do PS.
This has the advantage that it's platform independent,
anyone can edit/improve it with a simple editor.
Most of the Linux Doku is done this way. Any thoughts
about this?

I haven't been following that thread very closely, as I haven't
had much time to be online the past few days, so excuse me if
this has already been addressed, but where would one come up
with "grant money" to give to these developers? This sounds to
me like a good idea, though, especially in the area of (for us,
anyways) promoting Flight Gear to the general public that does not
avidly engage in online activities, and that may not have heard
of FGFS...

Would there be dues? Is that where the money would come from?

I really want to get this "team" thing going, but my time has
been severely limited between real life, school, FSNews, and
other online things... I promise I'll have a simple form-based
web page up by the end of the week, though, so everyone can
sign up for a team... hopefully we can coordinate development
on a broader level if we're "labled" :)

Any have pilot friends/or who are pilots? Specifically, we
might want to look into jet and prop sounds as a base, and
looking towards more unconventional sources for mixing in with
these. If you look at how audio special effects mixers work in
the TV/movie industry, you'll usually find odd-ball sounds turn
out to sound pretty close to the real thing when different
effects re applied (slow it down, etc.)

I will need to upgrade my hardware before I can try win95 which means
I won't be doing that for quite some time.  That's what I get for
getting married and buying a house ... no more fun toys.  :-)

Here is what has been proposed.

  - Charge all developers a $10.00 lifetime membership fee to help
    cover startup costs.

  - From there on out, any money would come from cd sales, and
    possibly donations.

  - This money would be given out as grants to developers at the
    completion of the project to reimburse them for the cost of things
    like charts for scenery developers.

I can see a lot of problems cropping up when ever money enters the
picture.  I don't think this should be the motive of the developers.
Fair distribution of cd profits will cause no end to grief I'm sure.

I personally think it is a good idea that is worth exploring, but I
don't expect, plan, or hope to get any profit out of the deal.  The
primary goal is to unite the freeware flight simulator developers on a
high level to combat thievery of peoples hard work.

Curt.

I saw some posts a while back about the proposed "Object
Definition Language" (ODL) that would be used to describe
objects and scenery for Flight Gear. Has anyone started on this
at all, even in some restricted sense?

I'm not sure how far along we are, but if we are going to have
different teams that work alongside the kernel developers (like
Eric), shouldn't there be a team whose job it is to come up
with the structure of all the binaries and of the scripting
language used to build and compile scenery, aircraft, and the
like?

I know this is far from where we are now, but some other things
along this line to think about in the future might be...

	* A CAD-like program for building aircraft
	* GUI-based compilers for scenery

... and so on. At this point, I'm ASSUMING that we (used in the
sense of the people on this list that will be in official
teams) will publish an official release when it is warranted,
like the POV-Ray project, with other independent developers
making modified versions that are seperate from our own. Am I
correct in this assumption?

Regards,
Dave

What kind of computer do you have? Jeez, if I can get 95
running on this hunk of junk that I have, anyone can. :-)
It's a 486SX/25MHz, 8MB of RAM, a non-VESA compatible XVGA
video card (512K of dram). Need I say more? ;-)

Also, I downloaded FGDJG.ZIP (153K) last night from Eric's web
site, but when I run FGMAIN.EXE, it just says "Something
failed." You'll recall I'm using Windows95 on the system
described above. Is this version only compatible with regular
DOS? I haven't tried FGMAIN even in straight DOS7. 

Can anyone figure out from what I've said exactly what the
problem is? I believe someone else said they got it to work
under Win95... 

Thanks,
Dave

Get US Navy Fighters... yeah, I know, it's a "shoot-em-up"
game, but I go it yesterday, and I'm already addicted. It's
from '94 (that's why it actually runs on my system ;)

Does "Windows" include Win95? I'm not running it from DOS mode,
or whatever M$ calls it... :)

I am working on the ODL.  :)  I am *trying* to get a scenery 
arctitecture together.  I am using my local municipal airports as a 
start.  Most of this is in wireframe, and I trying to keep the language 
open.  I'll post a spec soon.  :)

I have a 486-66/DX2, but I am really low on disk space.  I suppose I
could get it running, but I'm not too optimistic about FSFW95 frame
rates which would be my only motivation for upgrading anyways.
Installing win95 has about the same appeal as trying to swallow

[dig, dig, dig, rustle, rustle, rustle]

Here is an excerpt from a previous message by Eric:

  You might need to be running full screen DOS in order for the binary to
  work properly.

  The binary requires a DPMI server (such as Windows, CWSDPMI.exe or
  QDPMI.exe)  I'll put CWSDPMI at my Web page.  If you put it into the
  flight gear directory it should run under plain dos.

Hope this helps,

Curt.

I really need to spread out that if statement in fg_main() to
have better error reporting capabilities.  My guesses as to the
problem...

Not enough DPMI memory in your windows 95 dos box?
	- if so increase the DPMI memory setting.

The file fltgear.ini is missing or corrupted?
	- it should look something like this....

I had some thoughts on this which I expressed in a posting some time
ago. My idea was to make scenery development as platform- independent as
possible, and to allow chaotic development of scenery design tools. For
example, it would be possible to use FS5 sceneries with FGFS and FGFS
sceneries with FS5. This would require some conversion tools, but any
thinking about these can only start after programmers agree on the
low-level format. IMHO, the proposed ODL is too abstract to be the
low-level format. However, a worked-out version of it could serve as a
common denominator for graphical object design utilities.

I am not planning to join the FGFS development team now, but I will
probably consider FGFS in my scenery design tools. That is, I will leave
a 'back door' which will allow writing a converter into FGFS in the
future.

> * A CAD-like program for building aircraft

I am planning to start some work on a 3-D object designer for FS5/FS95
in the near future. I could make it capable of producing some output
that could be used in the Flight Gear project too. Then, my tool could
be useful for FS95 _and_ FGFS at the same time.

> * GUI-based compilers for scenery

Again, I think it is now pointless to write a big scenery design utility
specially for FGFS. It is still too hypothetical now, and this means too
little motivation for developing dedicated freeware (and commercial too)
tools. However, it would be possible to leave 'back doors' in scenery
design utilities for, say, FS95, that would allow using them to design
FGFS scenery when the time comes.

 >> I can see a lot of problems cropping up when ever money enters the
 picture.  I don't think this should be the motive of the developers.
 Fair distribution of cd profits will cause no end to grief I'm sure.

 I personally think it is a good idea that is worth exploring, but I
 don't expect, plan, or hope to get any profit out of the deal.  The
 primary goal is to unite the freeware flight simulator developers on a
 high level to combat thievery of peoples hard work. <<

 Personally I don't see how any fair distribution of any money could ever be
worked out and too much time would be spent trying to figure that out rather
than working on code.

 People just have to decide if they want to be a part of this project or not.
 If they want to do another project that is money driven even if it is to cover
expenses then that's a whole different thing. This should be a hobby and that
means people who do the hobby pay their own costs.

 Secondly combating theivery of peoples work can't be a big goal either. Either
something is going to be free and the code in the public domain or it's not. It
too hard to do it any other way. People who contribute code need to do it
knowing there is a good chance that if it becomes popular part of it will be
explioted by commercial people. That is the sign of success. I think that
allowing both commercial and non commercial exploitation of the code
encourages quick adoption and widespread desemination. After something is up
and running that is good enough to make people want to use it  then there will
be plenty of opportunity for developers to make money to offset costs by 
creating commercial add ons if they feel the need to do that. But they better
be good if they are going to compete with the freeware stuff that will come
out. One only has to look at the abundance of free scenery for FS5 out there
to realize that.

 If people secretly desire to get some money from this project (they may not
even realize this themselves yet) and are going to feel jilted later if it
doesn't happen then they are getting involved in the wrong project.

 I can say that this thread alone has probably discouraged several people from
wanting to get involved.

 Instead people should be discussing texture mapping, multiplayer connections
(internet please not just ipx), combat and general aviation issues, flight
modeling techniques, collision detection, sound effects, scalability of all of
the above for slower and faster machines etc.

 The code hould have a central data structure where exchange of realevant
conditions are exchanged between program threads or modules.
 Ideally the amount of processors time allocated to each module could be
proportioned dynamically by the user. thu those who care more about visuals
could set the terrain renederer to get 70 percent of the CPU loops and those
who care more about flight modeling could set that module to get more of the
CPU loops.
 The default would be for the program to cycle through each loop spending as
much time as defined in each one.

 Thus say in the main data exchange structure the planes current position,
speed, and rates of change of position etc would be in a data structure that
could be accessed by the terrain rendering module, the flight module, the
weather module, the collision module, the internet multiplayer module, etc
etc. If this data structure is defined it becomes easy for others to
independently develop modules without being involved in all parts of the code.
Ideally each module would be a separate dll file so one could simply chose the
dll file they want on their sytem to change the modules. Thus maybe one
wireframe terreainrenderer would be available and maybe another would be
texture mapped or 3D. Which is wanted by the end user could be copied to his
hard drive.

 Maybe a list of generic dll names to be called by the main loop would be:
 terrain.dll
 collision.dll
 flighteq.dll
 internet.dll
 sounds.dll

 Thus people could just rename the terrain rendering dll of their choice
terrain.dll and the program would use it.
 Obviously each dll module would need to provide common functions and
procedutres but how they did each function could be different.

 So lets say the main data exchange structure holds the current position and
velocity and angular vectors for the plane. Johnny can now write a terrain
render module based on reading that structure alone, David can write a flight
module using that and airframe info and, Billy can write a collision module
for combat or crashes. Every one can concentrate on what they like and
multiple mudules can be available for download so the program can be very
customized just by which module you decide to download.

 On texture mapping I have a few thoughts:
 The rendering model should provide for different ground textures to be used at
different heights above the earth. This would avoid the tiling effect one gets
in FS when high above the ground.

 Another good idea would be for it to display angled textures such as a texture
for when the craft is looking toward or away from the ground. Thus a front view
would show texture "woodsfront" and a look straight down would show "woods
down" and a look out the back would show "woodsretreat" textures.
 This would provide a means to have a real sense of traveling over the ground.
a forest or anyother thing looks different whether you are looking at it as
you approach or on top of it or have passed it and are looking out the rear
view window.

 I propose a layered standard texture name system for all textures.
 for example wdsfxx.txr where xx is a number.
 Thus wdsfxx would be woods textures as seen approaching from the front
windscreen with a number designating it's detail level.

 Everyone would have a basic wdsf01 texture on their system along with plains,
farms, ice, water, etc. Scenery designers could specify a wdsf34 texture in
their scenery files. The program would know to look for the wdsf34 texture but
if it wasn't found the program would default to the next level of genericness
(indicated by a lower number) using the wdsf01 in the end for example if no
other texture was available.
 The beauty of this system is it would allow the use of huge highly detailed
texture maps for those who wanted to download them yet would allow those who
don't to still enjoy the scenery with the generic levels of textures.

 Those are some thoughts for now.

George,

I saw the following message in the flight-sim@grove.iup.edu mailing
list.

  Subject: Re: Right Bros. [30931] [31033]

  What we need is more than a press release.  We need some stories about
  Flight Simming and Flight-Sim@grove.iup.edu printed in a few major
  publications.  I remember a short while back when Popular Science (or was
  it Mechanics?) printed a brief article and just mentioned
  Flight-Sim@grove.iup.edu.  The mail volume on the list jumped dramatically
  with first timers asking what the list was all about.

  We need well written article that explains the freeware idea and all the
  scenery, planes and adventures done that way and where to find it.


I have been doing a fair amount of thinking along these lines lately
(and have probably been doing a wee bit to much microsoft bashing at
the same time but that's a whole different story.)

I don't know if you'd be interested in publishing such an article in
your magazine, but if so, I would be interested in submitting
something short for your consideration.  I am envisioning something
that explains the freeware ideal, and talks about some of the 3rd
party add ons to FS5, then maybe concludes by describing how this all
applies to Flight Gear.

I'm not master journalist, but I did have an article published in the
Linux journal on my freeware CBB program.  (CBB is a [c]heck [b]ook
[b]alancing program for Unix.)  (http://www.me.umn.edu/~clolson/cbb)

Let me know if it sounds like something you might be interested in.

Thanks,

Curt.

Dear Group,

after following development of FlightGear only as a 
spectator for some time I think I can add a few 
things now.

1) I'm not a developer, thus I'm unable to contribute 
to (or even to document) the stuff Eric is developing. 
However, I have some experience with typesetting 
articles/books in LaTeX. Thus, I could try to make a 
first user documentation describing

-What's the goal of the project (could include some
 of the material from C. Olson's page)
-How to install the binaries and get them running on 
 several platforms
-How to recompile on several platforms.
-Common Problems
-Some additional stuff (GnuCopyleft etc.)

I would prefer preparing a LaTeX document which has 
the advantage of being platform independen, too.
Moreover,anyone can add/correct/improve material
with a simple text editor. I would ike to convert the 
final document to Postscript giving it a nice style 
and making it possible for the
beginner to print it out without any knowledge of LaTeX.

I already started working on this, and I think if all 
goes well I will be ready within a week or so.

I need input on two topics:
---------------------------

a) At this time I can only run the binaries and 
recompile them under DOS or Win95 (yes, it runs in win95 
full screen already). I need input on running the 
binaries/recompiling on the other platforms.
Thus, may I ask those who tried this to report what's 
necessary, what are the main problems etc.
Replies, please, either to the list (might be useful for 
discussion) or to me privately via email.

Please, keep this simple. I want to make user documentation 
being readable by people who only want to RUN FlightGear 
(Although at this time they need some fantasy, to see the 
flight simulator behind this...).
I'm sure this has to be supplemented by a FlightGear 
programmers handbook describing the modules, their interrelation, 
the calls, etc. This one obviously must be written by an 
expert in this field.

b) This will be very preliminary, of course. In addition, 
I'm not a native englich speaker, thus there will we 
sure some need to correct my poor english.


----------------------------------------------------

2) There was a proposal about making the project more
popular by writing some journal articles. I think
this is a good idea and I'll try to add a little bit
to this. There is a new (2nd issue just appeared) german
journal devoted to flight simming only. I will try to
contact the publishers and ask them about a short article
(in german, of yourse), but only after completing task one.

Dear Group,

could anyone who successfully re-compiled fltgear under DOS
give me a hint? I've got the following problem.

1.) My setup: I run DOS7 by booting win95 straight to a DOS
prompt. I installed DJGPP 2.0 and the Allegro Libray as indicated
in the documentation (Path etc.). The test Programs of DJGPP
as well as building the Allgero library work fine. I copied
the Allegro library liballeg.a to \LIB and the header 
allegro.h to \INCLUDE. 

2. I made a separate directory \SOURCE, got the source 
fltgear.zip and unpacked it into this dir. In addition, I 
observed that I need dll101.zip. After unpacking dll101.zip 
I copied all the files from the subdirectories
(up to the makefile) to \SOURCE. I found that 
running make within \SOURCE\SRC\DLL did not have any effect, 
because the object code as well as the
executables are already provided.

3. Within \SOURCE I called

 make -f makefile.djg.

In the first 
run I got an error statement indicating that some 'if' statement in 
allegro.h is not correct. I removed 
the allegro.h provided with fltgear because I had generated my 
own one while building Allegro anyway. Now, first steps of 
compiling goes well resulting in dthe object modules
 fgmain.o, fgload.o, and dll.o.

However, at
	gcc $(CFLAGS) -o fgmain fgmain.o fgload.o
I  get a whole bunch of errors indicating that some functions within 
fgmain and fgload could not be resolved:

fgmain.o: In function `main_loop':
fgmain.c:175: undefined reference to `__dj_stderr'
fgmain.c:178: undefined reference to `send_fgevent'
fgmain.c:180: undefined reference to `send_fgevent'
fgmain.c:182: undefined reference to `send_fgevent'
....
....
....
etc.

and make exits with an error 1.

4. Making in a DOS window of win95 completely failed with the message

MAKE.EXE: *** No rule to make target `fgmain.o', needed by
`fgmain.exe'.  Stop.
I guess that's a win95 problem.

5. I tried the cygnus (win32) port of gcc with essentially the same
result.

I would like to set up a docu describing the process, which I'm
obviously unable
to do with this result.

Greetings,

I thought I would just give a little status report of what I was
playing around with this weekend.

Let me start out by saying that I in no way wish to pre-empt anyone
who may also be working on similar things ... 

Anyways, I grabbed the flight model code out of the ACM program and
was able to compile a ".o" ... it is completely untested, so I don't
know exactly what I have going yet (if anything.)  Right now it is
just a simple ".o" and not a flight gear module ... I will look into
doing that next.  I will also have to look into issues such as what
sorts of units it expects, and how it assumes the world is being
modeled ... plenty to keep me busy.  :-)

ACM also comes with a lot of other flight sim code including a HUD, so
I might try to get some of that working at the same time.  It also
comes with a lot of multi-player, combat type code ... I am going to
look at preserving as much of that as I can.  There is no sense in
ripping it out if it is already there. 

My goal is to wire in the flight model and HUD so that you can
actually fly ... without scenery though ... it will look like you are
in 0 visibility conditions (if it works.)  :-)

The whole point of this exercise is to get as many things working as
possible with as little effort as possible.  But to do it in such a
way that the various modules can be replaced with modules that are
much better down the road as time permits.

Now if anyone out there is working on similar things, please don't
worry.  Flight Gear is a platform that should support many flight
models ... each with their own advantages/disadvantages.

I have a long way to go before I will have anything close to useful to
show, but I will be sure to let everyone know when/if I do.

Thanks,

Curt.

The problem is I forgot to update the djgpp makefile in 
"fltgear.zip"  I've done so now.
I need to reorganize my directories one of these days to make sure
the right stuff is in the right place :(

Eric

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A quick update.........

-Key events work under X11 but not DJGPP or OS/2.

-Scaled fonts work under X11 and OS/2

-The fgclock driver displays current Zulu time.

-Display bitmaps can now be of any size (as set by the width/height field
 of the fgscreen line of fltgear.ini)  (must be a legal size for the display)

-Bitmap sizes/locations in fltgear.ini are now in scaled coordinates (0-999).

-These changes are found in "fgnew.zip".  They don't work under DJGPP yet.

-I'll be working on key/mouse/input dialogs in the next week or two.
  (the DJGPP key events won't work until I get that done).

Eric

Hi all,

	Okay, I've finally narrowed my problem with running
FG... I'm missing the .ini file. However, I've been told that
the one on Eric's web site is missing two lines and that
there's a corrected one available some where else, but where?

I checked Curt's site, but I couldn't find anything. Could
someone please send me the file privately? Thanks!

Regards,
Dave

My workstation had a bit of a disk crash and the NFS tables have not
gotten updated with the new location of my home directory yet.  Hopefully
they'll do so and reboot the web server tonight.

Hi all -- this is revision 3.0 beta of the FGFS proposal.
Please let me know if there is anything you would like to see
added/deleted/changed before I release it "to the public". 

                       FLIGHT GEAR FLIGHT SIMULATOR
                    revision 3.0 - Wednesday, 10.30.96

V.   Contacting the Development Committee

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT / MISSION STATEMENT

On April 8, 1996, David Murr (dmurr@pen.k12.va.us), drawing on ideas
brought forth by others, proposed a new flight simulator developed by 
volunteers over the Internet. This flight simulator was to be distributed
free of charge via the Internet and similar networks.

Since that day, the project that has come to be known as "Flight Gear Flight
Simulator" has mushroomed in size and scope. As of this writing, a large
number of people have inquired about the project and offered their services
in various areas, including kernel development, world building, 
documentation writers, and testers. In only a few short months, Flight Gear
has managed to attract the attention of at least one prominent flight sim
magazine, Computer Pilot, as well as a chance encouter with a real life
aerospace company. 

So, what exactly is our goal? Briefly, it is to create a new flight 
simulator from scratch that:

	* is freely available from the Internet and possibly CD-ROMs
	* is developed cooperatively over the Internet by fellow simmers
	* is in agreement with the GNU license
	* accurately models the geography of the entire world
	* has accurate flight modeling
	* has extendable capabilities by providing the simulator's 
	  source code and extensive documentation of file structures.

If you would like more information on the current events regarding FGFS,
please visit the FGFS website at: http://www.menet.umn.edu/~clolson/fgfs/, 
maintained by Curt Olson. Another site for miscellaneous information will
be served at: http://www.erols.com/fsnews/fgfs/.

If you are unfamiliar with the concept by which Flight Gear will be 
developed and distributed, please see resources on the following software
projects: 

	* Linux (http://www.linux.org)
	* POV-Ray (http://www.povray.org)

II. NEWS AND UPDATES (as of November 1, 1996)

Please check the Flight Gear website for the most recent information,
however, as of Nov. 1, 1996, these people are known to be working
on the following items:

* Eric Korpela (Kernel [DOS, Linux, SUN-OS])
	- Implementing basic functions for Flight Gear
	- Kernel development
	- Adding keyboard and mouse support

* Curt Olson (Admin/PR/Kernel)
	- Picking apart another free flight simulator for Linux, ACM, to
	  try and extract information that might be useful to FGFS
	- Maintaining the mailing list and website

* Dean Catalano (Flight Modeling)
	- Working on flight modeling

* Michael Basler (Docs)
	- Coming up with some preliminary documentation provided in 
	  LaTeX and PostScript formats

* David Murr (Admin)
	- Converting LaTeX documentation source to HTML

* Matt Pickering (Win95 port, PR)
	- Working on a port of FGFS to Windows 95
	- Bussiness connection

III. A SIMPLIFIED "WISH-LIST"

This list should not be considered complete at all. It is just a small
listing of features that we would like to see incorperated in version 1.0
of Flight Gear and beyond.

- Multi-player functions for local networks, modem connections, and over 
  the Internet
- An interactive, intelligent ATC. Simulator add-ons such as Flight Simulator
  Flight Shop provide ATC functions, but often do not recognize the 
  area's topography, sometimes leading one into mountains and other
  objects.
- MSFS 5.1-level graphics or better. 24-bit graphics are being explored at
  this time.
- Acceptable frame-rates on a 486DX-66. Optimal minimum system configuration
  might be: Pentium 133MHz, 24-bit graphics card, Linux or Windows 95, 
  1-2MB of VRAM, a sound card, CD-ROM, and a mouse or compatible pointing
  device.
- Possible compatibility with Microsoft Flight Simulator scenery files. 
  Please understand that this is NOT very likely, especially in the early
  stages of Flight Gear, however, if this is possible, it would allow 
  coverage of a vast part of the world already designed (originally for
  FS5/FSFW95)
- A wide selection of default available aircraft.
- GPS display and other such modern avionics on the default panels

At this point, we're looking at the following operating systems for porting:
	* Linux/X11
	* Windows 95
	* OS/2
	* DOS
	* SUN-OS
	* MacOS (Yes, Mac lovers, we're including you too! ;)

If there are any features you'd like to see that you haven't seen mentioned
on the website or in this document, please submit them to us on the 
mailing list.

IV. THE GNU PUBLIC LICENSE

Please see: http://www.erols.com/fsnews/fgfs/gnu/ for a copy of the GNU
License. It is rather long, and as such, we are not including it directly
in this propsal document.

Well, I replaced the .INI file I had with the one Eric sent me.. and I
still get "Something failed.". I'm attempting to run it under Win95 full
screen. Is there anyone else having problems with it?

Thanks,

yup, I'm having problems too. But I haven't played around with it enough to
figure out what they are yet!!

BTW folks, I found on the net (www.scitechsoft.com) a set of SVGA libs for
C/C++ that are from the same folks that brought us univbe. These libs,
called SVGA Kit v6.0 are free for download and a made available for free,
unless you are going to use them for commercial software. Advantages are
that they support DOS, Win32, and Win16 (probably won't need the last one).
I am looking into them, they support several compilers, but I didn't see
anything about DJGPP, but they might work with a little porting. I think
they may help us with Win32 though. Check it out.

Dean

PS. Dave - put me down for aircraft modeling and aircraft systems.

Dear Curt,

I tried your Linux executable.
Unfortunately I got the message

"could not load library libdl.so.1"

Reason could be that our distributions 
are incompatible. I have a rather small but recent
one called XLinux. (Could install a TransAmeritex CD,
however, which is a year old...) Which one do you have?

Checking my libraries I found that indeed this one is missing.
However, my guess is that it's not a standard lib but
generated while compiling flight gear. Could you
check? Might correspond to the dll101 of the DOS version,
which however seems to be statically linked. Only a guess,
might be wrong...

Greetings Michael (pmb@rz.uni-jena.de)

Do you have DJGPP and gdb installed?  If so could you step through
fg_main and tell me which part of the if statement causes it to
bomb out?  My guess would be that it does so in "allocate_display_bitmaps()"
Does the screen flash to graphics mode and then come back to text?

I'm going to add something to fgmain.c to help diagnosis.

Eric

David,

I put your proposal on the Flight Gear web page near the top.  Could
you check it and make sure it is all there.  There was some possible
wierdness at the end of your email and I wanted to make sure nothing
got truncated.

Thanks,

Curt.

David, 

	I think v3.0 proposal looks good.

few questions for group discussion.

1. What is an "acceptable frame rate"? 5,10,15 fps?

2. What will be our initial targeted screen resolution?

3. P-133 optimal or middle of the road?

4. what about other platforms (ie LINUX, Mac)? Are the same capabilities
possible there?
I imagine so, since DOS is the "dog" that's holding everyone back! :-)

> 1. What is an "acceptable frame rate"? 5,10,15 fps?

I'd say 10 fps is about a minimum.

> 2. What will be our initial targeted screen resolution?

All of the above.  The X and OS/2 versions (fgnew.zip) are currently 
pixel resolution independant (but not color depth independant).  At home 
I've had the DJGPP version working at 320x200x8, 640x480x8, 1024x768x8.
I assume it would also work at 1280x1024x8, but my monitor doesn't support
that resolution.

The device drivers should automatically size themselves on startup to
fit the bitmap they are given.  They should also resize themselves if
their *_init routine gets a FG_BITMAP_CHANGE message.

> 3. P-133 optimal or middle of the road?

We'll fing out when we get there.  I'm using a P-90 now, but who knows
what I'll be using at release.

> 4. what about other platforms (ie LINUX, Mac)? Are the same capabilities

So far there have been few problems.  (Although I haven't gotten to 24 bit
color, sound, mice, or any Mac stuff yet.)

I don't think so.

Eric,

	Sorry about the brevity of that last e-mail. I was just
about to be cut off (provider was going to reboot). Here is
exactly what happens when I run FGMAIN.EXE from Windows95.

(BTW, it is set to start as a full screen app)

1. The program launches, full screen. It stays this way for a
fraction of a second and then..

2. it switches over to a windows app, with "Finished - fgmain"
in the title bar.

I do not think it ever enters a graphics mode, but I could be
mistaken.

The point is, I never see anything but "Something failed.".
Here's the .INI file I have. 

static fgini       1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
static fgpause     1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
static fgkbd       1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
static fgscreen    1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
static fgtimer     1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
static fgslew      1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
static fgrand      1 1 1 0 0 640 200 0
static fgbars      1 1 1 200 200 240 240 0

I'm assuming that's correct. I've never tried to run it from
straight DOS 7, just from within Win95 itself. Would this make
a difference?

Thanks,
Dave

No problem.  I'll upload a new binary with a better diagnostic for such
failures.  I'll put it up sometime tonight.

That could be the problem.  Allegro expects to see VESA 640x480
(at least the version you have).  The binary I post tonight will
have modes selectable by changing the fltgear.ini file.  That
should at least run 320x200 without VESA compatibility.

eric,

	I just thought of something else that was abnormal with
my video system. It's not VESA compatible. (That's why I have
to run FS5 in VGA mode unless I run UniVBE first.) Does this
make any difference at this point?

Dave

PS: Sorry for sending all this to the list, but I'm hoping
others that may be having problems will benefit from this
somehow. :)

I was just sent a proposed logo by Dean Catalano
(flight@intercons.com).  It looks like a nice ray traced image.  I
have placed it on the FG web page next to David's project proposal
(v3.0).  Feel free to check it out.

BTW, I'm edging ever closer to having an initial working flight model.
I don't know if I'll get a chance to work on it more tonight ... the
dishes are really stacking up in the sink. :-)

Talk to you later,

Curt.

I have installed the Debian distribution.  /lib/libdl.so came with the
ldso_1.7.14-4 package -- "The Linux dynamic linker, library and
utilities".  It is a fairly standard library on many Unix's.  It is
used for dynamically loading modules.

Here is the library from my system... it isn't too big.  You could try
sticking these in /lib

Hope this works,

Curt.

Dear Curt,

thanks for the library. We had a holiday here in Germany
today; I used the time to re-install my Trans-Ameritech 
Linux Distribution including the gcc compiler. I think 
after completing the doku I find some time to recompile 
under Linux myself.

In the meantime I had a medium success in that I can make
the DOS executable now myself. Only pity is that it
crashes (contrary to the precompiled .exe)

Greetings Michael
