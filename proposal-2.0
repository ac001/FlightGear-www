** Please note that this file is a revision from an earlier on that
was sent out. It reflects some of the thoughts and observations made
by members of the development team, and of the "public". **

I. An introduction to the project

	An idea entered my head on Monday, April 8, 1996. "'Why wait 
around for some large company to make what WE want? Why not do it 
ourselves'". Think about it -- there's certainly not a lack creativty,
ingenuity, or desire among our tight-knit group of about 1 000. 
	
	What have we been posting to newsgroups for months, even
years? Wish lists. We forward them to webmasters at Microsoft, Sierra,
SubLogic, whomever, only to have the e-mails dumped in the "recycling
bin". 

	Let's examine what we have out there -- what has been
done already with what huge corporations like Microsoft have given
us.

1) We have dissected the file structure of nearly EVERYTHING to some
   extent with MS Flight Simulator 5.x.
2) Maurizio Gavoli (please excuse my spelling) and someone else whose
   name escapes me at the moment have created two excellent aircraft
   for MSFS5 - without the need of any add-on programs!
3) Chuck Dome, who "reverse-engineered" the .AIRcraft files and came
   up with AIRMOD, an excellent utility used to modify flight and 
   color characteristics of default (and the two Simula FlightWare planes)
   aircraft for FS5. Thanks, Chuck for a utility that certainly tided
   us over until the release of Flight Shop.
4) Curt Olson's Real-Wx, which allows the user to download real, current
   weather for a multitude of US and Canadian cities and automatically
   import that data directly into FS5!
5) The creators of FSASM, SCASM, BGLCOMP, BGLGEN, Airport, and countless
   other scenery creation utilities that have undone the .bgl files 
   and made the format publicly available, besides giving us excellent
   tools to make our own, even photo-realitic, scenery!

... and countless other, excellent contributions by generous simmers!
(Sorry guys, I don't have the space or time to list you all, but you
know who you are!)

	What does this have to do with Flight Gear, you ask? Well, I'm
sitting here, wondering, "With all this creativeness, WHY wouldn't be
possible to make our own simulator?". It only makes sense - it's the
next logical progression. Isn't it?

	So, now that you know where I'm coming from, let's get to
some of the specifics of the program.

II. Overview of main features and specs

Here is a "condensed" (though lengthy) list of things we DEFINATELY 
need in this program:

* Interactive, "smart" ATC that SPEAKS when there is a sound card present
  Perhaps two-way, verbal communcation between ATC and pilot.
  It would also know the topography of the scenery area so it doesn't
  "lead you into a mountain"!
* A "CUSeeMe" type communication
  to other pilots has been proposed, however this would take a 
  tremendous amount of bandwidth and is not feasible at THIS POINT. 
  A more reasonable approach would be to perhaps devote a server 
  (we don't want to overload Curt's wx server now do we? ;-)
  to providing a few "radio frequencies" (not really radio, of course)
  and using those, so you can talk to an automated "intelligent" ATC
  and other pilots on that frequency! Sounds fun, huh? :)
* ATP-level or better graphics (hopefully better than FS5, though)
* IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO RUN FG ON A 386! (Notice I said *POSSIBLE*, but
  probably not FEASIBLE!)
* Acceptable frame rate (~10fps) on a 486DX/50
** On a future possible standard 80686/250MHz computer, let's aim for
   no less than a cinematic frame rate, i.e., 25fps minimum.
* Probable minimum setup: 486SX/25 with 8-12 megs of RAM, 1MB VRAM,
  40MB of harddrive space plus 10 MB or more for aircraft, scenery, etc.
* 32-bit under DOS with a DMPI extender
* Written in C (GNU/DJGPP compilers), Ada, and assembly.
* Different, portable (both meanings) modules for each sections 
  (e.g.: scenery, wx, flight dyn, etc.)

** Optimum system at current time: 
	- 80586 (Pentium) DX/120MHz processor
	- Math Coprocessor
	- DOS 6.2 or later
	- 12-16 megs of RAM
	- 1-2 MB of VRAM (video card's memory)
	- graphics accelarator board
	- Full-time, 56.6Kbps ISDN Network Connection (Internet)
	  However, a minimum dial-in 14.4Kbps account is acceptable.
	  ** NOTE: this is only used for those wishing to get wx,
	     scenery, and ATC updates on the fly from a centralized
             Internet server. (Location to be determined)
	- A DEDICATED FLIGHT PROCESSOR! (Though not at all neccesary, it
          will make your flights a lot smoother if you have a dedicated
          computer connected to the main one that handles the network
          updates. (One of the main advantages hinges on connectivity,
          though the user will be able to enjoy many enhancements over
          current simulators with advanced polygon-rendering routines,
          32-bit architecture, open documentation of the file structures
          to encourage 3rd party FREEWARE addons... note: no shareware
          will be allowed to be associated with this program!)
	- A Sound Blaster compatible 16bit sound card (full duplex)
          for voice communcation with other pilots/ATC.
	- SVGA 800x600, 24bit color
	- What else?

* NO LONGER COMPATIBLE W/FS5 FILES! (??) Undecided at this point
* Well documented proprietory format for a/c, scenery, and panels
* Accurate, flyable flight models
* Accurate, but non-processor intensive graphics (good frame rate)
  No "bitmap textures". Remember the chunky textures in FS5 when you're
  lower than ~4000ft? None of those, hopefully.
* Accurate REAL WORLD representation of objects, especially major landmarks
  and monuments.
* Simple on-board radar system with GPS "moving map" display
* Default planes include Cessna SkyLane RG, Beechcraft Bonanza, a 
  hot air balloon, Boeing 777, maybe a float plane? What else??
* Ability to construct abstract shapes easily for scenery, such as
  the St. Louis arch, Mt. Rushmore, Leaning Tower of Pisa, etc.
* Written in C(++), assembly, and Ada? for controlled, robust, fast 
  code for optimum performance. 
* BONUS: We'll probably port it to Unix, Mac, and OS/2! 
* RUNS UNDER DOS 5.0 OR ABOVE! NO CD's AND **NO** WINDOWS 95! YAY!
* FREE! Flight Gear MUST be FREEWARE and easily accessible via the
  Internet, AOL, Prodigy, CompuServe, Wow!, etc.
* The source code will be available for free, plus extensive docs
  on how we constructed different modules, etc.
* Some tech support by e-mail in spare time. No guarantees on this.

** Since we're talking about a possibly 5-year project
(though estimates have ranged from 2-10 years! :), our
speculations on system requirements will most likely be WAY
OFF, but since we don't know what's going to happen to computers
and networking in the future, and thus can't plan that far ahead,
we'll just have to adjust our code accordingly when it is deemed
necessary. **

**** GNU C/C++ standards will be used in C development.
**** Curt Olson proposes we use a centralized server for
wx, scenery, etc. that IS REAL TIME for those that are connected 
to the Internet at the time of program initialization. This would work
as such: when the user starts Flight Gear, it will test to see if a
connection is available, and if so, it will contact the wx server
and download current weather information and implement that in the sim,
as well as polling the server at a specific interval, say, 10 minutes to
download currently conditions...

Perhaps we could also tie in with a real-life ATC and re-create REAL
AIR TRAFFIC!! <g>

Automatic scenery updates would be available via this server as well.

For those who are not connected, we could implement a REALWX type
of program or just use RANDWXGEN...? 

Maurizio suggests we come up with a better mechanism for creating
scenery than BAO's. He says that the way the .bgl files are put 
together is very wasteful and slow. How can we render the buildings,
scenery faster...?

How do we get realistic-looking scenery without those framerate-killing,
awful bitmaps? They're chunky below 4000ft, and they are too SLOW!

I will continue to put more into here as warranted. Thanks. /dlm

III. So, who's gonna put this thing together?

Good question. Here is a list of people I *HOPE* to get on our team.
Keep in mind that I haven't contacted some of them yet, so...

* Maurizio Gavioli and Chuck Dome - implementation of aircraft
* Curt Olson - STN and wx development, C aide
* Enno Borgsteede and the SCASM/FSASM development teams - scenery
* Mark Stotzer - project consultant/supervisor
* Mike Vidal - flight modeling

(MG has signed on, as well as Michal Rok and CO. We have others as well, but
we're just getting ourselves together at this point. We hope to get
some "outside" help from C/ASM experts.)

... and others. These people seem to be experts in the particular field
I have placed them in, so...

IV. Got any kind of release date yet?

Let's say "Years." As in five years. Who knows?
