Trial and Error Tuning</A>
</H2>

<P>
The most basic method of tuning is the trial and error method. This
method involves adjusting the proportional gain, the integral time and
the derivative time until the performance is satisfactory. The three
settings are often adjusted separately in order to see the effects of
the different settings. This process can be time consuming.

<P>
It can be difficult to get started using the trial end error
method. What kind of gains and times should one start out with? A
typical approach for tuning a PID controller can be summarized as
follows:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Eliminate integral and derivative action by setting the
  derivative time, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img23.png"
 ALT="$ T_{d}$"></SPAN>, to its minimum value (zero) and the
  integral time, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img22.png"
 ALT="$ T_{i}$"></SPAN> to its maximum value.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Set the proportional gain, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.png"
 ALT="$ K_{P}$"></SPAN> to a low value
  (0.5) and enable the controller.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Increase the proportional gain by small increments until
  continuous cycling occurs after a small set-point or load
  change. The term "continuous cycling" refers to a sustained
  oscillation with constant amplitude.  At first it might be useful to
  increment <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.png"
 ALT="$ K_{P}$"></SPAN> by an order of magnitude (i.e. multiply or divide
  by 10) just to get yourself in the right ball park.  Then you might
  consider doubling or dividing by two to get closer.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Reduce the gain by a factor of two.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Decrease the integral time until continuous cycling occurs
  again. Set integral time, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img22.png"
 ALT="$ T_{i}$"></SPAN> to three times this value.  Note
  that because of the way the formulas are constructed, a smaller
  integral time means a larger integral component.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Increase derivative time, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img23.png"
 ALT="$ T_{d}$"></SPAN> until continuous cycling
  occurs. Set derivative time to one-third of this value.  Note that
  because of the way the formulas are constructed, a larger derivative
  time means a larger derivative component (which is opposite from the
  effect of changing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img22.png"
 ALT="$ T_{i}$"></SPAN>.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
The proportional gain that results in continuous cycling in Step 3 is
called the ultimate gain. In performing the experimental test to find
the ultimate gain, it is important that the output does not
saturate. If saturation occurs it is possible to get continuous
cycling even though the gain is higher than the ultimate gain. This
would then result in a too high gain in Step 4.

<P>
Disadvantages of the trial and error method include:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>It is quite time consuming if a large number of trials are
  required in order to find the ultimate gain and the integral and
  derivative times that result in continuous cycling.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The method is not applicable to processes that are open-loop
  unstable because such processes are typically unstable at both high
  and low gain values and are stable for intermediate gain values.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Some simple processes do not have an ultimate gain.
</LI>
</UL>
