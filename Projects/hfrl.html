<P>

In the past, the Human Factors Research Lab has done a variety of
aviation related projects funded by the FAA and NASA.  Current lab
research and projects are primarily centered around ground
transportation issues, but two of the old aviation simulators are
still sitting "in the back."
<P>

In preparation for a presentation to the local Minnesota chapter of
SIGGRAPH I retrofited our Agwagon sim with FlightGear.

of the sim</A>.
<P>

The retrofit involved connecting a modern computer to the large TV
monitor and resolving sync and connectivity issues.  The sim contains
a joystick that original cost $3000.  It is connected to an old 486
running an early version of Linux.  It's still possible to fire up the
old 486 and read the joystick positions so I wrote a little joystick
server app that talks to the running version of flight gear.
<P>

The end result is that you can sit in the sim, see the rendered
display on the big monitor, and fly with the joystick.  It's nothing
too spectacular, but it's kind of fun, and worked great for my
presentation.
