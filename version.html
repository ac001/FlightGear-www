         library that could be reused used for any general aviation
         cockpit.

    <LI> Clean up much of the extraneous alias system entries for
         aircraft.  Generally this means that if there is only one
         version of an aircraft, there is only one entry and no
         aliases.  If there are multiple versions of an aircraft, we
         may still have an alias to point to the preferred or default
         version.

    <LI> Added RedHat packaging files.

    <LI> Added some perl script utility functions which are useful
         when writing remote perl scripts that interact with a running

         brakes vs. the cockpit controls vs. the wheels they apply to.

    <LI> Much infrastructure added to support future GPS instruments.

    <LI> Fixed a meter/feet conversion problem in DME distance
         calculations which would cause it to often read quite high.

    <LI> Fixes to nmea output so it can better trick a moving map
         software application into thinking it is talking to a real
         gps.

    <LI> Fixed a subtle problem with our star database that has been
         lurking for many years, but it took an astronomy expert to
         spot the subtle misalignments.

    <LI> Add support for Logitech Extreme 3D Pro, thrustmaster top gun
         afterburner USB, Logitech WingMan Force 3D, Logitech Extreme
         3D Pro USB, and Microsoft SideWinder 3D Pro joysticks.

    <LI> Removed the old WeatherCM module (it can be resurrected from
         CVS if any one ever wants to do that.)

    <LI> Removed the NetworkOLK module (it can be resurrected from CVS
         if any one ever wants to do that.)

	   a remote computer.
      <LI> Improvements to flight model initialization.
      <LI> Fixes and improvements to the save/restore code.
      <LI> Added a load/save dialog box for saving/restoring your
           current flight. 
      <LI> Program notes max texture size for your card/driver so it
           can load higher resultion textures if they are available
	   and if you can use them.
      <LI> Added a visibility= command line option for setting intial
           visibility distance.
      <LI> Range of tiles loaded and drawn are now directly calculated
           from the current visibility distance so that the ground
	   always blends smoothly into sky. 
      <LI> Rewrote the tile caching scheme so it is now more flexible,
           more dynamic, simpler, and more robust.
      <LI> Updates to the FDM bus.
      <LI> Many clean ups with the view code to prepare the way for a
           greater variety of external views.

      <LI> Tweaks to build with newest gcc under Irix contributed by
           Erik Hofman. 

      <LI> Clean out a pile of old junk in the material manager
           library from the pre-ssg days, and majorly overhauled it.
      <LI> Complete reengineering of the panel code in preparation for
           moving the configuration out into a data file.
      <LI> Lots of hashing around with Joystick support trying to
           achieve something that is flexible enough to handle the
	   zillions of possible configurations out there.  Hopefully
	   we are approaching a workable solution. 
      <LI> Better windows support in our joystick module.
      <LI> View code simplifications and optimizations contributed by
           Norman Vine. 

      <LI> Added support for $FG_SCENERY and --fg-scenery=path so

  <H3>May 18, 2000:  Development Version 0.7.3 released</H3>
       <P>
    <UL>
      <LI> Added a radio stack 2 VOR/ILS and an ADF to the instrument panel.
           You can change the frequencies by clicking on the knobs on the
	   instrument panels.  You can now navigate with VOR/ADF/DME and fly
	   ILS approaches.
      <LI> Added a chronometer to the instrument panel.
      <LI> Added a "wet" compass to the top of the instrument panel.
      <LI> Compass, vsi, and altitute instruments and vacuum system are more

      <LI> Heading bug now display magnetic heading rather than true heading.
      <LI> Autopilot now has modes to track a VOR and GS.
      <LI> Added custom joystick client support so sim can be flown from a
           remote joystick connected to another machine.  This is in support of
	   some custom hardware located in the human factors research lab of the
	   university of minnesota.
      <LI> HUD controls are a bit different "h" toggles through day/night/off
           modes and "H" cycles through brightness levels.
      <LI> Norman Vine contributed code to optionally do antialiased hud lines
           on hardware that supports this.  Norman also contributed additional
	   hud cleanups and updates.
      <LI> Updates to JSBsim flight dynamics code that includes a generic
           reconfigurable flight control system, a initial state trimming
	   routine, support for wind and weather, support for flaps,
	   independent trim control, config files changes
      <LI> Updates to LaRCsim flight dynamcis code contributed by UIUC that
           allows loading aircraft specifications at runtime from
	   config files.  UIUC is using flightgear as a platform to do
	   icing research.  The UIUC aircraft use the c172 gear model
	   for now which causes some weirdness on the ground for some
	   of the larger aircraft. 
      <LI> Flight model no longer has to be chosen at compile time.
      <LI> Separated ephemeris code from the actual sky rendering code
           and gave this whole section a big overhaul.  The moon
	   should now consistantly have the correct phase.
      <LI> Rebuilt the sky dome using ssg.
      <LI> Removed dependencies on mat3.h and friends (old srgp support lib)
      <LI> Airport lookups now done through gdbm (a light weight
           embedded database.) 
      <LI> Converted ssgVTable's to ssgVtxTables which do proper memory
           management and should facilitate use of compiled vertex arrays once
           ssg add support for these.
      <LI> Overhauled autopilot internals, separated out the gui controls from
           the actual autopilot code.
      <LI> Cygwin32 build fixes

  <H3>February 17, 2000:  Development Version 0.7.2 released</H3>
       <P>
    <UL>
      <LI> Lots of code reorganizations

      <LI> Added flaps support to control model.
      <LI> Lots of updates and tweaks for the LaRCsim/c172 model.
      <LI> Use a more standard texture/blend mode combination for
           sun/moon halos to avoid render path that's not supported by
	   all cards/drivers.
      <LI> Change reported speed on hud from V_equiv_kts to V_calibrated_kts
      <LI> Instrument panel rewrite by David Megginson.  This isn't
           quite as flashy as the first pass, but is much more
	   functional, plays much better with opengl, and it should be
	   relatively easy for someone with graphical skills to make
	   it look more spiffy.
      <LI> MacOS fixes contributed by Darrell Walisser.
      <LI> Many JSBsim updates.
      <LI> Added a screen snapshot facility (F3).
      <LI> Added a load/save state function contributed by David Megginson.
      <LI> Added support for various I/O protocols and channels so
           that flightgear can communicate with itself and other
	   programs through a variety of means.
      <LI> Bug fix:  The aircraft model used for external views was
           being included in the height above terrain check so when
	   the view position and the aircraft model collided the
	   current altitude kept getting pushed up to compensate, but
	   of course the aircraft model would get pushed up as well
	   because it tracks the current aircraft position and
	   orientation.  Thus you had a never ending cycle ...
      <LI> Oliver's multiplayer network code now moved to his own
           subdirectory: NetworkOLK
      <LI> Added simulated cloud puffs as we pass through the cloud layer.
      <LI> Cleaned up some memory leaks occuring between ssg and flightgear.

      <LI> Added a hot air balloon simulator mode. (alpha)
      <LI> Added a simple (direct lincage) autocoordation feature.
      <LI> Added a mode to control view (side to side and up and down) with 
           the mouse.
      <LI> Fixed a DEM decoding problem which caused most of the terrain to 
           be 256 meter too high (and regenerated the world scenery with 
           proper elevations.)
      <LI> Updates to JSBsim.
      <LI> Added support for a pilot view offset from the center of gravity.
      <LI> Various platform portability fixes.
      <LI> Updated time-offset/syncing command line options.
      <LI> Updated the FDM <==> Flight Gear interface to be more object 
           oriented.  This should hopefully pave the way for being able to 
           simulate several concurrent entities.
      <LI> Removed unimplemented menu entries.
      <LI> Various scenery tools changes and enhancements in preparation for 
           adding runways (hopefully for the next release.)

      <LI> Added support for mouse yoke control contributed by David Megginson.
      <LI> FDM model hertz now definable from the command line.
      <LI> Added initial timezone support so the user can have better control 
           and more options for setting the starting time of the sim.
      <LI> We now draw nonexistant tiles as ocean which means we only have to 
           create and distribute tiles that contain some sort of land mass.
      <P>

      <LI> Replaced basic render engine with plib's ssg (simple scene graph).
      <LI> Now expect plib to be installed in it's one true and official 
           location.
      <LI> Added support for timegm() if it exists which explicitely expects
           GMT input.
      <LI> A bit of your basic code reorganization and shuffling.
      <P>

      <LI> Removed tools dependency on libgfc.  Functionality is now covered by 
           shapelib which has been added into the Tools tree.
      <LI> Added support for the wonderful GSHHS global land mass data set.
      <LI> Removed dependecy on process-dem.pl script.
      <LI> Created a new distributed/parallel tile build system ... hmmm kind
           of super computer or beowulf style stuff for getting large chunks
           of scenery built as fast as possible.
      <LI> Only generate tiles that have land mass data since the sim can 
           recreate pure ocean tiles on the fly.
      <LI> First stab at a water flattening scheme to prevent oceans, lakes, 
           and rivers from running up and down the sides of hills.
      <LI> Changed the default "Work/" subdirectory layout.
      <LI> Updates to better handle segment boundaries in preparation for 
           real airport runway and lighting modeling.

      <LI> Updates to JSBsim contributed by Jon Berndt.
      <LI> Created a tile load queue so that we only load one tile per
           frame.  This isn't entirely satisfactory, but it reduces
	   the length of the pause when crossing a tile boundary with
	   several shorter pauses.
      <LI> Fixed bug with passing PUI keystrokes on to glut.
      <LI> Fixed a bug in tilecache size which caused occasional tiles
           to drop out when more than one row is scheduled

           gaps have been fixed, distorted textures have been fixed,
	   real coastlines have been added, and many other subtle
	   improvements. 
      <LI> Tools for parallelizing the scenery building tasks.  For
           instance by using 20 machines in parallel, scenery for the
	   entire USA can be regenerated in just over 4 hours vs. 70+
	   hours on a single machine.  
      <LI> Texture scale can be specified (and changed)( in the
           materials file.  The sim must be rerun for the change to
	   take effect.
      <LI> Windows now uses plib joystick code so rudder pedals should
           now work. 
      <LI> Now builds against Steve Baker's plib (portable game devel
           library) distributed separately
	   (www.woodsoup.org/~sbaker/plib/)

      <LI> Fixed AOA reading on the HUD.
      <LI> Added random splash screens.
      <LI> Modified scenery loader to accept tri-fans.
      <LI> Other non-backwards compatible changes to scenery file
           format and tile layout.
    </UL>
 
  <H3>Februrary 10, 1999:  Version 0.58 released</H3>
    <UL>
      <LI> Added JSBsim alpha code ... this is Jon S. Berndts alpha FDM rewrite.
           Still lots to do, but you can watch a balistic flight for a short 
           time.
      <LI> Renamed Simulator/Flight to Simulator/FDM
      <LI> Tweaks to assist building FGFS on solaris platforms.
      <LI> Moved Lib/DEM to Tools/DEM
      <LI> Started preparations for scenery generation tools overhaul.
      <LI> More MSVC++ support.
      <LI> Removed code that made the sun bigger at the horizon since this is 
           just an optical illusion in real life.
      <LI> Bug fixed so that the sim can start out at an airport below sea 
           level.
    </UL>
    <P>

  <H3>January 21, 1999:  Version 0.57 released</H3>
    <UL>
      <LI> Converted to a simpler frame rate counting method.
      <LI> Fixed the AOA reading on the HUD.
      <LI> Removed gpc from the Lib section of distribution by request of the
           gpc Author.  The gpc license is unfortunately not compatible with
           the GPL.  I may look for an alternative library, or just require
           that developers download this library separately.
      <LI> First slew of changes from the MacOS porting effort
           contributed by "Robert Puyol" <PUYOL@ABVENT.FR>.
      <LI> Support for an arbitrary number of serial ports +
           additional serial port output tweaks.
      <LI> Serial output tweaks to make things more robust and act
           more like a GPS.
      <LI> Portability enhancements for Borland, Solaris, and SGI.
      <LI> Some internal class renaming and reorganizations.  fgFLIGHT
           becomes FGState.  fgCONTROLS becomes FGControls.
      <LI> Started work on an "external" flight model so the sim can
           be driven from external input (serial port, network, file,
           etc.)
      <LI> Fixed a problem that creeped in with setting the initial
           startup altitude.  This could cause an unrecoverable bounce
           and you'd end up flipped on your back.  Should be fixed
           now.
      <LI> Sun now appears to grow in size as it gets very low in the
           horizon.
      <LI> Fixed a view frustum culling bug where the scene was not
           accurately culled when your view was anything other than
           straight forward.
    </UL>
    <P>

  <H3>November 23, 1998:  Version 0.56 released</H3>
    <UL>
      <LI> Changed default HUD units to the more standard feet units.
           You can still use meters by specifying the command line
           option "--units-meters".
      <LI> Added some initial joystick support using Steve's joystick
           interface class.  This works great under Linux, but Steve's
	   class now needs to be ported to Windoze and other platforms.
      <LI> Also added a fall back to the GLUT joystick routines for
           windows (until we can find better joystick support.)
      <LI> Added some initial serial port support for acting like gps
           and outputing nmea data such that could be fed into a
	   flight map software package. 
      <LI> Miscellaneous code clean ups, portability improvements, and
           optimizations. 
      <LI> Switched to a streams based error/debug logging system that
           can be completely stripped out for a release build
	   (./configure --without-logging) 
      <LI> Support for cygwin32 b20 compiler (latest release)
      <LI> Continued progress on instrument panel
      <LI> Support for starting fgfs at higher resolutions.
      <LI> Updated user manual.
    </UL>

  <H3>October 23, 1998:  Version 0.55 released</H3>
    <UL>
      <LI> New version of gpc (generic polygon clipping library) from 
           http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/aig/staff/alan/software/
      <LI> Brakes (use "b" to toggle)
      <LI> Added an altitude hold module to the autopilot.  Lock your
           current altitude with "ctrl-a", "cntr-a" again will
	   deactivate.  (Also lock your current heading with "ctrl-h",
           and again to deactivate.) 
      <LI> Added a terrain following module ... "ctrl-t" to activate.
      <LI> Added an autothrottle ... "ctrl-s" to activate.
      <LI> Fixes so that terrain tools will work in windoze.
      <LI> More STL & Compiler compatibility fixes.
      <LI> Changes to use a Point3 class.
      <LI> Fixed win95/98 time problem that limited fps to about 18.3
    </UL>
    <P>

  <H3>September 25, 1998:  Version 0.54 released</H3>
       <UL>
         <LI> Implimented audio envelopes so that pitch of engine
	      changes with throttle
	 <LI> Textured moon, and rewritten/restructured Astro code.
	 <LI> More optimizations and code cleanups.  (Norman Vine,
              Bernie Bright, Charlie Hotchkiss.)
         <LI> Bug fixed that was causing odd display artifacts due to
              a degenerate fragment being created for every tile.
         <LI> Bug fixed that caused scenery generation to go bad
              (misplaced fclose on an invalid file descriptor.)
         <LI> Code changes to support g++ 2.7 STL (from Bernie Bright)

  <H3>September 25, 1998:  USA Scenery now
       available</H3>  Through the graceous contribution of Jim
       Brennan, the entire FG rendition of the USA terrain is now
       available online for download at
       <A HREF="ftp://ftp.kingmont.com/pub/kingmont/">
       ftp://ftp.kingmont.com/pub/kingmont/</A>
       <P>
       The files are in 10 x 10 degree chunks and are labeled by the
       lon/lat of their lower left hand corner.
       <P>
       To fly out of a particular scenery area you just specify a
       starting airport in that area with the --airport-id=ABCD option.
       You can also start at a specific lon/lat with the --lon=nnn.nnn
       --lat=nnn.nnn options. 
       <P>
       If you would like to arrange to receive the entire USA scenery
       on cdrom, you can contact me at

       <P>


  <H3>September 2, 1998: Version 0.53 released</H3>
    <UL>
      <LI> Some initial "GameGLUT" support contributed by Gary R. Van
           Sickle (tiberius@braemarinc.com)
      <LI> Tracked down and eliminated some memory access type bugs
           that were causing segfaults on some platforms, with some
	   compilers using various optimization flags.
      <LI> Assorted code optimizations submitted by Norman Vine.
      <LI> Renamed fg to fgfs
      <LI> Shuffled files.  
        <UL>
          <LI> Created a new directory Simulator/Airports/ to handle
               airport data specific tasks 
          <LI> Created Simulator/Object/ to handle basic rendering
               objects 
        </UL>
      <LI> Panel code update from Friedemann Reinhard (use
           --enable-panel to activate) 
      <LI> Contributions from Bernie Bright
        <UL>
          <LI> Created some new classes to enable
               pointers-to-functions and pointers-to-class-methods to
	       be treated like objects.  These objects can be
	       registered with fgEVENT_MGR.
          <LI> File "Include/fg_callback.hxx" contains the callback
               class defns.
          <LI> Modified fgEVENT and fgEVENT_MGR to use the callback
               classes.  Also some minor tweaks to STL usage.
          <LI> Added file "Include/fg_stl_config.h" to deal with STL
               portability issues.  Added an initial config for egcs
	       (and probably gcc-2.8.x). Don't have access to Visual
	       C++ so I've left that for someone else. 
          <LI> This file is influenced by the stl_config.h file
               delivered with egcs. 
          <LI> Added "Include/auto_ptr.hxx" which contains an
               implementation of the STL auto_ptr class which is not
	       provided in all STL implementations and is needed to
	       use the callback classes.
          <LI> Deleted fgLightUpdate() which was just a wrapper to
               call fgLIGHT::Update(). 
          <LI> Modified fg_init.cxx to register two method callbacks
               in place of the old wrapper functions.
          <LI> The new classes in libmisc.tgz define a stream
               interface into zlib.  I've put these in a new
	       directory, Lib/Misc.  Feel free to rename it to
	       something more appropriate.  However you'll have to
	       change the include directives in all the other files.
	       Additionally you'll have add the library to
	       Lib/Makefile.am and Simulator/Main/Makefile.am.

          <LI> The StopWatch class in Lib/Misc requires a
               HAVE_GETRUSAGE autoconf test so I've included the
	       required changes in config.tgz.
                                                                              
          <LI> There are a fair few changes to Simulator/Objects as
               I've moved things around.  Loading tiles is quicker but
	       thats not where the delay is.  Tile loading takes a few
	       tenths of a second per file on a P200 but it seems to
	       be the post-processing that leads to a noticeable blip
	       in framerate.  I suppose its time to start profiling to
	       see where the delays are.

          <LI> I've included a brief description of each archives contents.

            <UL>
              <LI> Lib/Misc/
                   zfstream.cxx
                   zfstream.hxx
                   C++ stream interface into zlib.
                   Taken from zlib-1.1.3/contrib/iostream/.
                   Minor mods for STL compatibility.
                   There's no copyright associated with these so I
		   assume they're covered by zlib's.

              <LI> fgstream.cxx
                   fgstream.hxx
                   FlightGear input stream using gz_ifstream.  Tries to open the
                   given filename.  If that fails then filename is
		   examined and a ".gz" suffix is removed or appended
		   and that file is opened. 

              <LI> stopwatch.hxx
                   A simple timer for benchmarking.  Not used in
		   production code.  Taken from the Blitz++ project.
		   Covered by GPL. 

              <LI> strutils.cxx
                   strutils.hxx
                   Some simple string manipulation routines.

              <LI> Simulator/Airports/
                   Load airports database using fgstream.
                   Changed fgAIRPORTS to use set<> instead of map<>.
                   Added bool fgAIRPORTS::search() as a neater way
		   doing the lookup.  Returns true if found.

              <LI> Simulator/Astro/
                   Modified fgStarsInit() to load stars database using fgstream.

              <LI> Simulator/Objects/
                   Modified fgObjLoad() to use fgstream.
                   Modified fgMATERIAL_MGR::load_lib() to use fgstream.
                   Many changes to fgMATERIAL.
                   Some changes to fgFRAGMENT but I forget what!
