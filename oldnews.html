   <LI> <B>December 20, 2002:</B> Two papers were recently presented
        at the European Space Agency ASTRA 2002 conference.  Both

        vehicles on foreign planets using terrain recognition; the
        other discusses the development of a fuzzy autopilot designed
        to control an autonomous flying vehicle operating in the Mars
        atmosphere.  Both can be found in the <A HREF="Docs">Papers
