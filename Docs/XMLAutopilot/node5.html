Derivative</A>

<P>
Hopefully someone else can chip in and add more explanation to this
section.  But going back again to calculus.  The derivative of a
function implies the rate of change of the function output.  If you
know the function, you can take the derivative of that function to
produce a second function.  For any point in time, the derivative
function will tell you the rate of change (or slope) of the first
function.

<P>
Conceptually, this makes sense in the context of a controller.  How
quickly we are closing on our target value (i.e. the rate of change
from each time step to the next) is an important piece of information
that can help us build a more stable system that more quickly achieves
the target value.

<P>
For a car cruise control, we are measuring velocity at each time
step.  The rate of change of velocity is defined as acceleration (for
those that remember your physics.)

<P>
Now don't you wish you took calculus and physics in school?  Or if you
did take them, don't you wish you had been paying attention?  Me
too. :-)
