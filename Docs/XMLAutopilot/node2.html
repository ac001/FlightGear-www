Control Theory 101</A>
</H1>

<P>
I find control theory and PID algorithms very fascinating (at least at
a simple level) so I want to share a few basics.  Although the
FlightGear PID algorithm is a bit more sophisticated, effective
control modules can be built  with just a few simple building blocks.

<P>
Typical autopilots are built using a PID algorithm.  PID stands for
proportional, integral, and derivative.  Typically a PID controller
manipulates one control output to force a process value towards a
reference point.

<P>
Let me say that again an a bit different way.  Imagine a cruise
control on a car.  We know the current speed.  We know the target
speed.  And we know the accelerator position.  The cruise control will
manipulate the accelerator position (control output) to try to make
the current speed (process value) equal to the target speed (reference
point.)  How the cruise control calculates what accelerator position
is needed to hold the desired speed (even going up and down hills) is
where the magic happens.

<P>
I'll explain the three components (proportional, integral, and
derivative) of a PID controller next.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000">
Proportional</A>
</H2>

<P>
All three components of the PID algorithm are driven by the difference
between the process value (i.e. the current speed) and the reference
point (i.e. the target speed.)  We will call this difference (of
error) for one particular time step <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$ e_{n}$"></SPAN>.  For that same time step,
we call the process value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$ y_{n}$"></SPAN> and the reference point <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$ r_{n}$"></SPAN>.

<P>
<!-- MATH

e_{n} = r_{n} - y_{n}

<P></P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay">

 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$\displaystyle e_{n} = r_{n} - y_{n} $">
</DIV><P></P>

<P>
The output value (i.e. the accelerator position) is called <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$ u_{n}$"></SPAN>.

<P>
The proportional component simply calculates <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$ u_{n}$"></SPAN> based on the
size of the error term <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.png"
 ALT="$ K_{P}$"></SPAN>.

<P>
<!-- MATH

\end{displaymath}

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay">

<P>
For simple situations, this all by itself can be a very effect control
algorithm.  Typically this works best when you know that when <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="57" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.png"
 ALT="$ e_{n} =
0$"></SPAN> then <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="59" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.png"
 ALT="$ u_{n} = 0$"></SPAN>.  For example, imagine a simple wing leveler in an
aircraft.  The process value is going to be bank angle, the reference
point is going to be zero (zero bank angle means the wings are level.)
Assume a well trimmed aircraft with neutral stability so that when the
ailerons are zero there is no change in bank.  A proportional only
control would set the aileron deflection inversely proportional to the
bank angle.  As the bank angle gets closer to zero, the aileron
deflection gets closer to zero.  Something as simple as this (a
formula with one multiply operation) can be an amazingly effective and
stable controller.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00022000000000000000">
Integral</A>
</H2>

<P>
Unfortunately life is often more complicated than we'd like, and even
in the case of a simple wing leveler, you encounter situations where
the aircraft isn't perfectly trim and zero aileron deflection does not
always equal zero roll motion.  In an aircraft such as a Cessna 172,
the amount of aileron deflection needed to keep the wing level can
vary with speed.  In these cases, a proportional only controller will
stabilize out quickly, but will stabilize to the wrong value.  We need
a way to drive the error in the proportional only controller to zero.

<P>
Enter the Integral component of the PID algorithm.  Remember back to
your calculus days, integral refers to the area under a curve.  If you
have a function, the integral of that function produces a second
function which tells you the area under curve of the first function.

<P>
Fortunately we usually don't have a formula for the first function
since it changes depending on external conditions (i.e. current
speed in a car.)  That means we can't integrate this function directly
and we are spared all the potentially messy calculus.

<P>
So we use an alternative approach to approximate the error under the
process value curve.  At each time step we know <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$ e_{n}$"></SPAN> which is the
difference between the process value and the reference point.  If we
multiply this distance times <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img10.png"
 ALT="$ dt$"></SPAN> (the time step) we get an area which
approximates the error under the curve just for this time step.  If we
add these areas up over time, we get a very reasonable approximation
of the area under the curve.

<P>
Essentially what this does is that the longer time passes with us not
at our target value, the larger the sum of the (error <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img11.png"
 ALT="$ \cdot$"></SPAN> dt)'s becomes
over time.  If we use this sum to push our output value (i.e. our
accelerator position) then the longer we don't quite hit our target
speed, the further the system pushes the accelerator pedal.  Over
time, the integral component compensates for the error in the
proportional component and the system stabilizes out at the desired
speed.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00023000000000000000">
Derivative</A>
</H2>

<P>
Hopefully someone else can chip in and add more explanation to this
section.  But going back again to calculus.  The derivative of a
function implies the rate of change of the function output.  If you
know the function, you can take the derivative of that function to
produce a second function.  For any point in time, the derivative
function will tell you the rate of change (or slope) of the first
function.

<P>
Conceptually, this makes sense in the context of a controller.  How
quickly we are closing on our target value (i.e. the rate of change
from each time step to the next) is an important piece of information
that can help us build a more stable system that more quickly achieves
the target value.

<P>
For a car cruise control, we are measuring velocity at each time
step.  The rate of change of velocity is defined as acceleration (for
those that remember your physics.)

<P>
Now don't you wish you took calculus and physics in school?  Or if you
did take them, don't you wish you had been paying attention?  Me
too. :-)

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00024000000000000000">
Combining P + I + D</A>
</H2>

<P>
Here is a key point to understand.  The proportional component is very
stable.  The Integral and Derivative components are very unstable.

<P>
If we build a proportional only controller, it will be very stable but
will stabilize to the wrong value.  (i.e. if we want to go 90km/hr, it
might stabilize out to 82km/hr.)

<P>
If we build an integral only controller it will quickly hit the target
value, but will overshoot, then overcompensate, and will oscillate
wildly around the target value.  It is very unstable.

<P>
The trick then is to combine these components together by summing
them.  The actual output is equal to what the P component says the
output should be plus what the I component says the output should be
plus what the D component says the output should be.  You can assign a
weighting value to each component to increase or decrease it's
relative power to influence the final output value.

<P>

</DIV><P></P>

<P>
As you can see, the actual math involved in a PID controller (while
rooted in some deep theory) is actually quite simple to implement.
The real trick for creating a well behaved PID controller and a well
behaved autopilot is tuning the relative weights of each of the P, I,
and D components.
