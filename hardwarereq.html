<H1>FGFS Hardware Information</H1><BR>

Flight Gear is a fairly typical OpenGL application in terms of it's
performance and hardware requirements.  It requires a reasonable
hardware accelerated 3D card with full <STRONG>OpenGL</STRONG> drivers
to achieve smooth frame rates.  Software only rendering typically
yields frame rates in the neighborhood of 1 frame per second.  But,
with a 3d accelerated card you can expect much higher.  On a 1Ghz
class CPU with a GeForce card, frame rates in excess of 60 fps are
reasonable to expect in many situations.  The actual frame rate varies
of course with scene complexity (which changes from area to area and
changes as your view direction changes.)

<H3>OpenGL Drivers for Win32 and Mac</H3>

Most modern computers these days ship with hardware accelerated 3D
cards.  If you are having trouble running FlightGear it is often worth
your time to visit your card manufacturer's web site and download and
install the latest drivers for your card.
<A HREF="../Docs/InstallGuide/getstartap2.html#x13-57000B">
Appendix B of the FlightGear Installation and Getting Started
Guide</A> has some further information on configuring your machine to
run OpenGL applications.<BR><BR>

<H3>OpenGL Drivers for Linux, FreeBSD, etc.</H3>

I believe that voodoo, ati, and nvidia cards are all pretty well
supported by the PC Unixen.  Depending on your video card, your
distribution, and your sys-admin experience, getting accelerated
drivers running can be more or less of a challenge.  We have assembled
some information and pointers to information for configuring your 3d
card in

<H3>The Big Picture</H3>

Here is a bit of general background information on OpenGL and 3D
hardware acceleration contributed by Steve Baker

<P>

When you are drawing graphics in 3D, there are generally a hierarchy
of things to do:

<OL>
  <LI> Stuff you do per-frame (like reading the mouse, doing flight
       dynamics)

  <LI> Stuff you do per-object (like coarse culling, level-of-detail)

  <LI> Stuff you do per-polygon or per-vertex (like
       rotate/translate/clip/illuminate)

  <LI> Stuff you do per-pixel (shading, texturing, Z-buffering,
       alpha-blend)
</OL>

On a $1M full-scale flight simulator visual system, you do step (1) in
the main CPU, and the hardware takes care of (2), (3) and (4)
<P>

On a $100k SGI workstation, you do (1) and (2) and the hardware takes
care of (3) and (4)
<P>

On a $100 PC 3D card, you (or your OpenGL library software - which
runs on the main CPU) do (1), (2) and (3) and the hardware takes care
of (4).
<P>

On a machine without 3D hardware, the main CPU has to do everything.
<P>

The amount of work to do each of these operations goes up by one or
two orders of magnitude at each step. One eyepoint, perhaps a hundred
objects, tens of polygons per object, hundreds of pixels per polygon.
<P>

Hence, putting step (4) into hardware is vital - you could easily need
to draw a million pixels for each time you read the mouse. Putting
step (3) into hardware is also very nice - cards like the nVidia
GeForce are now doing this.
<P>

So, if you put a cheap accelerated 3D card onto a slow-ish PC, you
still get all the benefits of not doing the per-pixel math in software
- so your frame rate will speed up. But since that per-pixel stuff now
goes very fast, you are probably limited by the speed that your old
clunker can do step (3) - the per-vertex math.
<P>
A card like the GeForce which can do step (3) will bring you even
greater performance benefits on a slow-ish PC.
<P>

It has been suggested that even a 400MHz Pentium II couldn't feed
vertices to a Voodoo-2 card faster than it could process them.  That
was for a 'typical' scene though. If your polygons are very large (in
terms of screen area) then the amount of per-pixel math will increase
up to the point where even a slow PC would end up waiting for the 3D
card to complete the rendering of one polygon before it can accept the
next.
<P>

If your polygons are very small then the 3D card may not give you much
benefit.  There is a certain amount of overhead in sending each
polygon to the hardware from the main CPU - and that cost could
ultimately be more than the cost of drawing the pixels in software if
the polygons only cover a few pixels each.
<P>
 
If your 3D card doesn't provide a speedup then make sure you have a
proper OpenGL driver installed for that card - some cards only support
Direct3D which FGFS is unable to interface to. Some 3D cards can't
function if you set the display resolution too large or the pixel
depth to something that card won't support. Some OpenGL drivers
silently drop back to software-only rendering under those
circumstances.
<P>

In summary: Will a 3D card speed up FGFS on a standard PC? Yes -
immensely.
