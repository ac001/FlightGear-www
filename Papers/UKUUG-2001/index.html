This talk is only about visual scenery<BR>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>Among the dozens of simulator uses
		<UL>
		<LI>Each has a different emphasis and technical needs
		<LI>Unneeded features may be omitted to save resources
		<LI>Compromises are usually made in the implementation
		<LI>We prefer to offer run- and compile-time choices
		<LI>One of the benefits of being an open source project
		</UL>
	</UL>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>Visual scenery is a huge resource hog
		<UL>
		<LI>Application-specific optimization is critical
		<LI>This talk reviews why scenery is necessary
		<LI>Summarizes the standard FlightGear scenery
		<LI>Discusses some of the easy customizations

Scenery is often unnecessary<BR>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>For instrument flight rules (IFR)
		<UL>
		<LI>The pilots act the same inside as outside the clouds
		<LI>They operate the aircraft by reference to the instruments
		<LI>They navigate using electronic aids and radio instructions
		</UL>
	<LI>For dead reckoning trips
		<UL>
		<LI>The pilots use time/heading/distance to navigate
		<LI>The view outside is mostly optional during cruise
		<LI>Only a few specific landmarks are needed to check progress
		</UL>
	<LI>For night flight
		<UL>
		<LI>The world is black (except for towns and airports)
		<LI>Need to only show a blob of light for each town
		</UL>
	</UL>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>For these cases, should we bother ?
		<UL>
		<LI>Would it really just be eye candy ?

Visuals can be a distraction<BR>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>Popping in and out of sunny clouds
		<UL>
		<LI>Dim grey featureless background when inside a cloud
		<LI>Blinding white glare when emerging into sunlight
		<LI>Makes the instruments very hard to read
		</UL>
	<LI>Occasional small patches of ground
		<UL>
		<LI>Not big enough to identify any specific landmarks
		<LI>Not long enough to match patterns to the charts
		<LI>Distracts pilot from flying the plane
		<LI>Encourages erroneous changes in route
		</UL>
	<LI>Mountains in the distance
		<UL>
		<LI>A pretty background, static and easy to draw
		<LI>Too far away to estimate the aircraft's position
		<LI>Appears to confirm the pilot's opinions
		</UL>
	</UL>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>So, yes, even IFR benefits from scenery
		<UL>
		<LI>It all makes flying harder and more realistic

National data limitations<BR>

Mismatch of scenery and charts<BR>
