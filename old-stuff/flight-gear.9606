Hey guys,

Things have been kinda quite on this list lately.  Work + Life has
been sucking up most of my time.  I saw the following announcement on
comp.os.linux.announce.  I haven't yet had a chance to check this
thing out, but maybe it might be useful for our project?

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Announcing the release of JLib version 1.5
==========================================
  I have uploaded to x2ftp.oulu.fi the file jlib_1-5.zip,  which is  
version 1.5 of the JLib library.  I expect it to be moved to the
pub/msdos/programming/djgpp2 directory,  where it will replace jlib_1-3.zip,
which was an earlier version.

What is JLib?
=============

One Line Description:
  Portable Graphics/Gaming Library - DOS/Linux/X Windows/WATCOM.

Many Line Description:
  JLib is a gaming/graphics library for DOS (WATCOM or djgpp),Linux and
X windows.  It provides simple graphics primitives,  offscreen buffers and
sprite functions,  and includes documentation,  demos and miscellanious stuff.
Currently 320x200,640x480 and 800x600 256 color targets are provided for
dos,  linux,  X  and Watcom. X support is in development and currently lacks
input handling facilities. Other targets are being added.

  JLib comes as full C source code in a ready to build fashion (with 
makefiles) to keep the archive size small.  Installation instructions are 
included for all users.  It compiles under the latest V2 version of djgpp
and should work fine with C++,  Windows, OS/2 etc.

  JLib is 100% free,  therefore it comes with absolutely no warantee.  You 
are free to use JLib code in any product subject to the terms described  
in the included file "jlib.doc" (!=GPL).  JLib is copyright(c) 1995,1996 
Jonathan Griffiths.

Several features have been added from the previous release.
Highlights include:

 *  The first WATCOM targets,  welcome WATCOM users!
 *  Brand new multi svgalib target for linux.
 *  70 page word processed documentation.
 *  Bug fixes and support for generic targets.
 *  Some new primitives and palette operations.
 *  Simplification of installation and building the library.

Sounds great.  It'll probably save much duplication of effort.
I'll check it out wghen I get back from vacation. (24th or so.)

Another thing you guys might want to check out in relationship with
the jlib multi-platform graphics libraries is:

    ftp://x2ftp.oulu.fi/pub/msdos/programming/djgpp2/htgf_1-0.zip

This is a simple (DOS) demo program which was written on top of these
libraries.  It kind of reminded me of the Commanche? (heli-sim) style
graphics.  The performance seemed very smooth on my 486 66/DX2
although the program isn't doing a lot.

Just a couple of things which I have been pondering the last couple
days:

One of the first things I think we should do is get a 3-D display
engine running.  In doing this, we need to think about many issues
including:

- Are we going to write everything ourselves from the ground up, or
  should we build on one of the available 2-D graphics libraries such
  as jlib-1.5?  (I'm not aware of any freely available 3-D graphics
  engines -- maybe we should package ours up when it is done ... )

- Whatever we do, we need to make sure we can handle things like fog /
  visibility effects, and texture mapping.  It would be nice if
  whatever we do is portable, so flight-gear can run on multiple
  platforms.

- What approach are we going to use for hidden surface removal.  I
  assume we won't just be running on machines that can do this in
  hardware. :-)  My initial thoughts are that maybe we should
  implement some sort of z-buffering in software.  Another option
  would be to use some form of the painter's algorithm (draw furthest
  away things first) however, I think sorting by distance might have a 
  heavy performance penalty.

- We need to consider how our scenery/objects will be stored and
  organized.  This will probably influence how we design our 3-D
  engine.

So, do we have any 3-D graphics experts out there?  (If not, what are
we doing writing a flight simulator?)  :-) :-) :-)

I'm not sure that Flight Gear needs to have a whole new 3D engine, as
much as it needs to have a 3D API that can act as a thin layer over
whatever 3D engine is available on the target platform.  I strongly
believe that Flight Gear should be able to take advantage of such
technologies as OpenGL and Direct3D under Windows, and QuickDraw 3D on
the Mac, especially on machines that have 3D hardware.  (I don't know
what equivalent technologies exist under Unix, other than OpenGL.)

Of course, a baseline 3D engine should be written for those platforms
where a 3D engine is not readily available, but I think that can be
pursued as a separate project.

BTW, I guess I should introduce myself, I've just joined this mailing
list and am still getting up to speed on Flight Gear.  My name is
Robert Epps, and I am a disciple of the Evil Empire (a Windows
programmer).  My main area of interest is contributing to the 32-bit
Windows version of Flight Gear.  (I frankly believe that DOS and
16-bit Windows versions should not even be bothered with, because the
DOS market is well covered by FS5, and 16-bit Windows is just too
crippled for a highly graphical program like a flight simulator.)

Subject: Scenery Design?
Sender: owner-flight-gear

Reply-To: flight-gear@infoplane.com

I have a scenery design question for you all.

I was flying FS5 this weekend and made an observation.  The FS5 world
(obviously) is a flat plane with objects placed on top of it.  It
would be great if Flight-Gear's terrain could be a polygon (triangle)
mesh.  This would allow us to much more accurately represent the
world.

However, (and this is my observation) FS5's way of doing things is
much simpler, and requires much less processing time than would a 3-d
triangle mesh.

To do the things the way I would like, you would really have to spend
a huge effort doing hidden surface removal because conceivably, just
about any surface could at some time be in front of any other surface.

Two ways I can think of to do hidden surface removal on a DOS/Windows
PC is to sort all the polygons individually by distance from the
viewer, and then draw them from the furthest to the closest.  Sorting
becomes excruciatingly slow as the number of polygons increases.  A
triangle mesh would create lots of things to sort.  Another option
would be to use a software z-buffer.  This technique keeps track of
the depth (distance from viewer) of each pixel on the screen.  As you
are drawing each pixel of (scan converting) each line or polygon, you
check to see if that pixel is closer than the one that was already
drawn (using the z-buffer).  If it isn't closer, you draw the pixel,
and update the z-buffer, otherwise you just skip that pixel.  This way
you can draw the polygons in any order.

With FS5, though, things are much simpler.  I am speculating that for
each frame update, they sort all of their objects (usually not to
many) by distance from the viewer.  Then they draw out the ground
(easy -- just slap on the bitmaps) and finish by drawing all their
objects from furthest to closest.  This can still become slow if there
are many objects, but I can envision a few little tricks to speed
things up -- which they probably do.

So finally, the question is how do we want to approach this.  Do we
want to model our terrain using a triangle mesh?  This would pretty
much require a full fledged 3-d graphic engine, and would probably not
run to fast on machines without 3-d hardware support (i.e. high-end
SGI's)  Or, do we want to mimic FS5's simpler approach?  This would be
much easier to do on the programming side and would probably be able
to run much faster in general.  It would also make it easier if we
wanted to try to take advantage of all the wonderful scenery available
in bgl format?

I'd love to hear your thoughts,

Thanks,

Curt.

My thought would be to keep the fs5 scheme of using flat tiles
at least in Flight-Gears initial release.  As far as I know, we've just been 
introduced to triangular mesh with Shiratti Commander and Hans 
Meier's Mount and designers are finally laying down 3d mountains that 
look like mountains. Once this catches on, and I think it already

Curt,

Just a couple of observations on this. The naval simulator Harpoon uses a
Lambert Conformal Conic projection for its surface representations. These
are based on Defense Mapping Agency Global Navigation Charts. The docs do
point out, however, that this is possible in large part because most naval
activity takes place in areas of the earth where little distortion is
created by the conical representation. Also, Harpoon does not have to deal
with the "look down" factor from FL 330 which exists in a flight simulator.
On a polar flight, for instance, these distortions would be unacceptable.

Certainly some government agencies, such as NASA, DMA amd others have
already discovered ways of properly representing topographical features and
structures on a simulated "globe". Obviously most of these have been
designed for use on a mainframe of supercomputer. It's possible though, that
some of the *principles* which they use could be downsized to the PC.

And what about MS's Space Simulator. I haven't seen it yet, but is it
possible that they have incorporated a better model for representing the
Earth into it?

Good luck. This will be one of the most important decisions and design tasks
that your team will face.

My thought would be to keep the fs5 scheme of using flat tiles
at least in Flight-Gears initial release.  As far as I know, we've just been 
introduced to triangular mesh with Shiratti Commander and Hans 
Meier's Mount and designers are finally laying down 3d mountains that 
look like mountains. Once this catches on, and I think it already

I haven't gotten a chance to look a jlib yet (Just got back from vacation)
so I haven't seen how well it would handle some of the concepts I have
floating in my head.  (Subbitmaps, etc.)  Too many graphics packages
assume that a bitmap will be a contiguous memory region.  That's often
not the case.

I've been thinking of how to implement fog/visibility effects.  It seems
the best way is to modify palette entries (on 8 bit displays).  I think
this means that pallette allocation is going to have to change as conditions
change.  So whatever  library we use is going to have to allow us to
allocate and deallocate palette entries.  In the case of a full palette,
the allocation routine should give the closest match.  There should
also be some sort of palette priority. (i.e. I NEED this color, but that
one is just an added touch.)  Both clouds, fog, and haze can be simulated
by semitransparent polygons.  The polygon is assigned a red, green, and
blue transparency and luminance, and the colors of things behind are 
multiplied by these transparencies and the luminance is added.  You can
do some fairly realistic stuff like this.

Texture mapping is generally implemented over the polygon graphics.  The
polygon structure would contain a pointer to the texture bitmap.  Textures
are displayed by ray casting (similar to ray tracing).  For each pixel
the point of interection with the texture bitmap is calculated.  I think
it's best to get the polygons working before worrying about texture mapping.

I've played around with this a bit in the past, and rough distance sorting
seems to work best.  The quickest way of doing this seems to be defining
a midpoint normal for each polygon.  First you eliminate all polygons with
normals facing away from the viewer and those outsize the viewport, then you 
calculate distance to the midpoint of the remaining polygons and sort to get 
a z list of all the visible polygons.

I think a list like this would do the trick.....

typedef struct _FG_SCN_RECORD {
  FG_INT32  objtype;             /* code for type of object            */
  FG_INT32  length;              /* length of this record              */
  FG_INT32  lat0,lon0,lat1,lon1; /* lat/lon range where it is visibile */
/* object date goes here */
} FG_SCN_RECORD;

typedef struct _FG_3DPOLY_RECORD {
  FG_INT32  objtype;             /* set to FG_OBJ_3DPOLY               */
  FG_INT32  length;              /* set to length of this record       */
  FG_INT32  lat0,lon0,lat1,lon1; /* lat/lon range where it is visible  */
  FG_INT32  color;               /* color of this polygon (RGB)        */
  FG_I3VECT center;              /* polygon center                     */
  FG_I3VECT normal;              /* polygon normal                     */
  FG_INT32  n_vertices;          /* number of vertices                 */
/* vertex list goes here */
} FG_3DPOLY_RECORD;

#define FG_OBJ_GROUP 0
#define FG_OBJ_3DPOLY 1
...etc...

It's easily extended and allow for grouping of objects.  For example
a group of polygons might look like this.  It's also fairly easy to scan.
It's also easy to define a text scenery language for compilation.

objtype=0
length=length of this group
lat0,lon0,lat1,lon1=  limits for this group
  objtype=1
  length=length of this polygon
  lat0,lon0,lat1,lon1=  limits for this polygon
  color=255 (as blue as blue can be)
  center=               coordinates of polygon center
  normal=               vector normal
  n_vertices=3
  vertex1,vertex2,vertex3
 
  next polygon
end of group

I agree.  It was my intention to somehow obatain a 1 nmi resolution
ground level map for the world and use that as a basis for the scenery
world. (It would be a semi rectangular mesh rather than triangular,
but you get the point.)  In interesting areas the mesh could be finer.
I was also thinking of determining ground polygon color by altitude
and season.  (Although it would be nice to get a similar resolution
map of the actual ground color.  Anyone have a digitized real-color
world map? Both summer and winter?)

If each polygon has a visibility range and other selection criteria,
the number of calcuations to be done can be greatly reduced. (See my
last message about using the polygon normal to get rid of invisible polygons.)

(discussion of Z buffering deleted)

(discussion of Z sorting deleted)

In general, Z buffering in software works better if your number of
polygons to be displayed is 10% of the number of pixels.  I don't think
that'll be the case for our FS.  

Another method that hasn't been discussed is ray casting.  For each display
pixel you calculate the closest intercepted polygon.  I've never done it
for more than a subsection of a display, though. (i.e. texture mapping
a polygon.)

As far as using BGL and FS4 scenery, I'd like to see modules that allowed
it, but I don't think I'd like that to be our primary scenery method.

Flight-Gear developers,

I was just looking at the code for a program called xearth-1.0.  It is
a neat little utility (for Unix/X11) that displays a shaded view of
the earth from any position, using either a mercator or orthographic
projection.  It even knows the current sun position, and can shade out
the dark portions of the earth.

They use a very simple little idea which allows them to render the
"globe" accurately, even if the view is directly over one of the
poles.  I will attempt to describe the algorithm without understanding
it 100%. :-) They run all the data points (outlines of continents,
etc.)  through a simple transformation before displaying them.  For
instance, you can just rotate all your coordinates by a constant value
so that your current lat,lon equals 0,0.  Then you can proceed to
display your surroundings with the assumption that lat = y, lon = x
(or whichever way it goes).  They do things just a bit diffent than
what I have described, but the ideas is basically the same.  The
mercator projection centered on a point other than on the equator
yields some interesting maps since the distortions aren't in the usual
places.

    (They store all their data points in (x,y,z) format, such that
    each point will fall on the unit circle.  They then scale their
    coordintate by 30000 and keep them as integers ... this probably
    saves some calculations some where along the way)

So, what do you think about doing something like this to modeling our
world?

Thanks,

Curt.
