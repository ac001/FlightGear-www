Hi Curt and the other distinguished members of the list:

Well, I finally got some disk space freed up on my dying toy here, and got a
look at the screen shots of ACM.

Very nice.  I found the graphics to be better than what you claimed for FS4,
and better than Falcon.  It reminded me somwhat of Tornado.  I can
understand Riley's lack of a panel, since in a combat sim of this nature,
you concentrate on the HUD anyway, since it displays all the pertinent data
for your mission at hand.  I presume the rectangles on the panel are
annunciator lights for warning/failures.

I really feel that your proposal should be seriously undertaken, as I think
ACM could serve as an excelent base to build upon.  The good thing is that
it uses the TCP/IP stack for multi-user play, so this should fit in very
nicely for internet dual player etc.  I do not see this protocol going away
for a long time (the industry said the same thing about X.25, and it is
still around!)

As far as my comments about porting to other platforms, I also checked your
link to the ACM site, and saw that it runs on most of the OS's I mentioned,
so again, this reinforces my belief in my prior statement.

Please be aware that although I use to code, I have not coded in years.  I
can imagine the effort that would be required to build on existing code, but
I honestly believe that for the development team on this project, it could
save you a significant amount of time, and maybe put us in a position to
have a working program in 8 to 14 months?

Lets get going, as I'm itching to get the FDE's working and write the DOCS.

Now, if I could only get a toy that I could run Linux on, the compilers
required and check the program out further.

BTW Curt, I like the picture of the mascot!  What IQ does he have? :-)

This sounds like a great idea to me, especially if ACMs author
will cooperate with us! The screenshots look really nice,
certainly better than I thought our first draft of the sim
would be (~ATP level graphics w/out 3DAGS). Slap on some
photo-realistic panels, work on the scenery some, and looks
like we've got a nice sim with much less work than if we did it
completely from scratch.

I'm not going to comment on everything, since I've said what I
wanted to say right there. :) However, I wasnt to let y'all
know that I'm going to be putting up a small web page soon
(within the next couple of days) that will allow you to sign up
for teams, and see who's already on what. It will also include
a document authored by Shmuel Ben-Artzi that brings up some
very good administrative points. I'll pass along the URL as
soon as I know what it is. <g>

BTW - I got that picture of Hobie, the flight dog and touched
it up a little. I removed the background, made it tranparent. I
also brought out a little more detail in his head/face area and
corrected for bad lighting. <bg> Looks like a great mascot to
me! :) Thanks Curt! <s>

Curt,

Let me address a couple of concerns based principally on the questions of
broad-based usability. In the world of communications (technical or
otherwise) the first question that must always be asked is: "Who is my
probable target audience." This is also the first question that a marketing
analyst must ask when considering the development of a new product.

Developing for the broadest possible user base does not equate to designing
to the lowest common denominator. A minimal equipment/performance baseline
must be established at a high enough level to guarantee a truly superior
high-fidelity product. Obviously, the highest that we might aspire to would
a mega multi-user international system powered by a couple of Crays.
Impractical? Yeah, probably. 

How about a slightly-less-than-mega multi-user system based on Sun or Unix
systems? For the long haul, definitely. For the short term, I'm afraid
(though I'd love to be proved wrong on this one) that it's impractical
except for limited and localized applications. State of the art just isn't
there yet for the industry on an affordable, Internet-wide basis. Too narrow
on the readily-available bandwidth; too broad on the communications costs.
That leaves only intranet usage.

My own conviction on this then is that, for the present, FG's best hope for
broad enough acceptance to make it worth the effort lies in developing the
very best product that can be used as a single-player sim on a PC, while
also allowing (through OOAP) sufficiently portability to make it possible to
use it in a multi-user environment.

Where does this leave us with respect to ACM? 
IF the existing code development is truly superior to anything else that
might be made available to us as a starting point, *and*
IF that code can be *easily* reworked for PC (but not necessarily DOS)
applications.
THEN it might make an acceptable (maybe even great) launching pad.
IF NOT, then the code fiddling necessary to "make it fit" might require as
much effort as starting from scratch and building a more developer-friendly
platform. And even if we did succeed in "making it fit", we might wind up
with something less functional that what the extra "from scratch" effort
might have produced. 

Of course trade-offs will be necessary. A major constraint that we will have
to be guided by is available time of the participants. But why not start by
defining the absolute best that we *might* be able to achieve if all of the
conditions were just right, and then step back from there to the highest
acceptable compromise. 

Bottom Line: Has someone else already created a superior development
paradigm that we can use to achieve our highest objectives? If not, are we
willing to take on the task of redefining the whole paradigm of simming as
it applies to private and commercial aircraft?

The (operational) mission statement of the US Navy might be summed up in one
dictum: Put ordnance on the target IN SUPPORT OF THE MISSION.

What is the FG mission? Well, that has yet to be declared, but I'll throw in
my own candidate:
========================
To create the best high-fidelity civil/commercial flight simulation possible
for use by the general simming community. It should offer power simmers a
truly realistic experience while also offering casual simmers an opportunity
to enter at a level appropriate to their abilities and progress as far as
they desire.
========================

But a mission statement must be defined an accepted up front. Only then can
practical decisions about platforms, code development, etc. be made. And
each decisions must be made IN SUPPORT OF THE MISSION.

Well, I'm not really offering many answers. Just a bunch of new questions.
But as I once mentioned to Dave, one of my favorite roles is that of devil's
advocate. Hope you don't find that too obnoxious.

Shalom,

Shmuel

> ACM proposal deleted...

Sorry I've been so long replying, I've really been swamped lately.  I
have no objections to using the parts of ACM that can be fit into
our kernel/driver model.  ACM has come a long way since the last time
I looked at it (~1992).  I haven't had time to look at it, so I don't
know what the code looks like as far as modularity goes.  The 3 things
it has that we will probably want to look at taking are....

1) Flight model
2) 3D graphics code and scenery
3) HSI

If we can lift these without having to take on the entire program structure
I'd be happy.  For each of the above we'd need to convert to a flight
gear driver, and replace X calls with fggrx calls, we'll also need to
determine what variables need to be globally accesable to all drivers.

Changes I've made to my code recently include...

1)  Attempted MMX-like support
2)  Started X and DJGPP (allegro) display routines

What I'd like to do next is....
3)  Finish X and DJGPP display routines (add palette management)
4)  Add OS\2 display routines
5)  Cobble together a quick attitude indicator and compass
7)  Take the slew model for a test flight.

Once I've finished the display routines, a volunteer can add Windows and
Mac support.  Once the test flight is done, flight model, 3D and instrument
development can begin.  Once again, I'm swamped, so I don't when I'll get around
to this stuff.

I know we aren't quite ready for this, but I ran across a neat utility
today that might be useful so I thought I'd mention it before I
forgot.  It is called the Generic Mapping Tool.

    http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/soest/gmt.html

The neat part about it is that it comes with a 56Mb (that's
*megabytes*) compressed data base of coastal, river, lake outlines for
the entire globe.  They merged data from two public databases to get
their data set.  Have a look at their web page for more info ...

Elevation data is not included as far as I can tell.

This again would be down the road a ways, but we might want to look at
setting up an internet scenery server.  For the lucky net-connected
pilots, flightgear could automatically fetch surrounding scenery and
cache it locally.  This way you wouldn't have to store gajillions of
megabytes of scenery locally ...

I will stop before I get too far ahead of myself ... :-)

I've been looking a bit more at acm and I think Eric has made a good
suggestion.  ACM is *not* very modular.  Riley Rainey happily controls
all the development (which as I said before is fine since it *is* his
program.)  The graphics libraries is highly tied to X, and
dependencies on this is scattered all over.  People have had great
difficulty trying to port this to other platforms.

I think we should proceed separately from the acm effort, but feel
free to borrow large/small sections where ever makes sense.  If we do
borrow code, we must be sure to abide by the acm license, and we must
be sure to give them proper credit.

Eric continues to write:

Eric, this sounds great.  It looks like you are the *man*.  We are all
waiting to see your results so we can start to build on them.  No
pressure! :-)

Yep, being swamped is my problem too.  But, let me know if I can give
you a hand with any of this ... maybe if two or three of us work
together closely on the initial stuff, we can make some progress
without stepping on each other's toes too much.

Talk to y'all later,

Curt.

Curtis and all,

I was just thinking about MS's announcement that they will not be releasing
an FShop-type program with FSFW95, and it gave me an idea. What if, instead
of a full-blown sim engine, the FG group concentrated on a shorter-range
(for now, at least) project of producing a Win95 compatible design engine.
Much of the R&D needed to create the entire app would apply also to an
aircraft/scenery/ATC design package capable of creating component add-ons,
instrument add-ons (HSI, GPS, etc), adventure add-ons and so forth. But it
could be done more quickly.

It would be good to get the Win95 "icon of approval", but even without it,
such a package would go a long way toward sparking increased interest in the
more advanced aspects of simming. I don't remember MS ever giving approving
any freeware of shareware apps, but that's not to say that they might not if
the circumstances warranted it. 

If we could get the go-ahead from MS as a legitimate Windows-app design
team, then we could handle code compatibility in a straightforward fashion,
instead of with a series of workarounds. The thing would actually be
DESIGNED to operate efficiently alongside what, for better or worse, is
destined to become one of, if not the, most popular sim products on the
market. And this could always, if circumstances warranted, become just a
stepping stone to development of a complete stand-alone package.

Any ideas on this?

Shalom,
Shmuel

Hmm... correct me if I'm wrong -- but... I thought I saw
something about MS saying that FSFS planes would be compatible
with FSFW95, after being run through a converter. So, why would
we need an app like this, if we're able to use the old FSFS?
For the sake of making a better interface or what not?

Just curious?? :)

Talking with Bruce W. at MS yesterday and he told me that they will 
be working on a conversion utility to convert FS5 FSFS planes to 
FS6, but it will not be available right away. I'll have dig out my 
notes from the conversation, there are a few things he wouldn't 
(couldn't) be very specific about, as far as future plans to allow 
3rd party developers access to develop add-ons for FS. He did say 
that they were aware of the interest that these 3rd party add ons 
have generated.

On another note, Win95 game-development is slightly proprietary at 
the moment, with all the Games SDK and DirectX development tools and 
source that you need to license from MS. Kinda prevents the little 
guy from coming up with anything, unless they reinvent DirectX.

Principally because it would be better to have a design package that was
BUILT to operate alongside the main sim engine, rather than one that can
create compatible add-ons only through the use of a converter (which will
probably cost something in terms of performance). FSFS is okay for designing
16-bit stuff, but I'm pretty sure that only true 32-bit coding will be able
to make the grade after a while.

It's kind of like using scenery designed for FS4 with the 5.1 engine. Of
course we *can*, but how many of us *do*. Why not? It just doesn't make the
grade. Will 5.1 quality add-ons be the end of the line? I don't think so.

Licensing costs would present a problem. Question is, since this community
already has a reputation for turning out some good quality material, would
it be in MSs best interest to help us develop the tool that could perpetuate
that? If they intended to develop their own design package then obviously
not. But since they don't...

If a team of airline professionals, programers, applications development
specialists, etc. went to MS with some of the best examples of what this
group has designed in the last year and promised a continual flow of product
designed to work just as well with Win95 and beyond if they will just help
us to produce the design package and allow it to be freely distributed,
would they be interested? Maybe not. Then again.

Hi guys:

>Win95 game-development is slightly proprietary at the moment...

Actually, you can download the complete DirectX 2.0 SDK from the Microsoft
web site.  It's 39 megabytes, so it's not easy, but it is free and you can
redistribute the necessary DLLs with your applications.

Just lurking,
Adam Szofran
