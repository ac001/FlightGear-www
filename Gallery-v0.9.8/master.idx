<H2>FGFS Photo Gallery</H2>

I will try to put the most recent images first.  In general, the
closer you get to the bottom, the older the code was when the image
was captured.

<H3>June 2002 Vintage Images</H3>

Quite a bit of work has been done in support of 3d aircraft models and
animation which can be viewed from tower or chase plane views.  Also a
few of our ground cover textures have been recently reworked.  Here
are a few images:

<H3>April 2002 Vintage Images</H3>

Here are a few new screen shots taken in the March/April 2002 time frame.

<H3>Open Glass Cockpit Project</H3>

FlightGear now has an interface to the <A

<H3>Taxiways</H3>

We have added taxiways to the major world airports.  These are part of the airport and navaid database maintained by Robin Peel.

<H3>Photo-real airport environements</H3>

FlightGear has some initial support for chopping up aerial/satellite
photos and using them for scenery.  Here is an example from KSJC (San
Jose, CA) showing what can be done with a 64Mb video card.

Here are a few screen shots from around the pattern.  Note, these were
used for a presentation on runway incursion issues.  The final
approach to Taxiway 'Y' is bad, bad, bad and will probably result in
the loss of your ticket unless you have a really good excuse.  Still,
take offs and landings do mistakenly happen on this taxiway from time
to time.

We have also created a method to easily place runway signs using an
ascii text file, rather than having to do any 3d modeling.  Here are
some (sparse) examples.

<H3>Multiple Display Synchronization</H3>

FlightGear has native support for synchronizing multiple displays via
a network.

<H3>Land Use / Land Cover</H3>

David Megginson, recently added support for a global land cover/land use
database.  Here are some of the early results showing a variety of scenery
types.

<H3>Runways</H3>

Work has begun on adding runway markings.  Precision, non-precision, and
visual marking schemes will be supported as well as concrete, asphalt, dirt,
and turf surface types.
<P>
Our initial approach to drawing runway lines is to split the runway up into
sections and apply the proper texture to that section.  This way a huge variety
of runways can be constructed with a relatively "few" number of textures.

<H3>Clouds</H3>

Sure, these aren't quite the 3D clouds of "Fly!", but they still look very
nice and have a minimal impact on frame rates.

<H3>Scenery Work</H3>

I have begun an overhaul of the current scenery system to facilitate
adding things like lakes, rivers, urban areas, other land use areas,
and eventually streams and roads.  I finally got tile edge matching to 
work so I have added some new images.  Please note that the frame rate shown
in these images is misleading.  I have a 3dfx voodoo-2 and to take a screen
shot I have to flip the card into "in-a-window-hack" mode which kills 
frame rates.
<P>

Most recently, I have added "urban" areas.

<H3>Night shots</H3>

Here are some snap shots which show the night sky.  The Sun, Moon,
stars, and planets are all rendered in their correct position in the
sky.  Flight Gear has a large star data base so the stars (and
planets) are rendered with correct magnitude (brightness.)  Also, the
moon is rendered in the correct phase.

the texture maps.

<H3>Irregular Terrain Gridding</H3>

Flight Gear uses sophisticated <EM>irregularly gridded</EM> terrain.
Irregular grids are able to achieve the same detail level as a regular
grid, but with 4-6x fewer polygons.  We use a tool called Triangle
written by Jonathan R Shewchuk (Jonathan_R_Shewchuk@ux4.sp.cs.cmu.edu)
to connect the dots into a Delauney triangulation.
