Eric,

I grabbed your fltgear.zip and was trying to compile your code under
Linux.  So far here are a couple things I have run into:

In fgini.h I had to add two lines in order to pull in the definitions
for the structures used in lines 48 & 49.

    #include "fgevent.h"
    #include "fgdriver.h"

In fgmain.h the compile dies because it can't find FGDRIVER_CALL in
line 88.  I grep'ed the source and couldn't find this defined any
where.  I'm speculating that this might be a typo?  Just for fun I
changed it to FGDRIVER_INIT_CALL.  Then I found "driver_bitmap"
undefined in line 110.  Another typo?  Forging ahead, I changed this
to "driver_bitmaps".

Finally, I think I am giving up with an "incompatible types in
assignment" error for line 113.

    FG_DRIVER_FN static_drivers[] ...
    FGDRIVER_INIT driver_data[MAXDRIVERS] ...

    driver_data[next_driver++]=static_drivers[i](&callstruct);

I tried fiddling a bit with these to see if I could get the compiler
past this point, but didn't make too much progress.

I also looked at your Linux specific defines and everything looks
pretty much as it should.  

Looks like you have been keeping yourself busy. :-)

Thanks,

Curt.

I could work on this or my thesis. :)

Hello developers!

I have been fiddling around a bit today with the FlightGear web page.
Feel free to have a look at it and let me know what sorts of
changes & suggestions you would like to see.

I would like to add a section which lists who is working on what and
how it is coming along.  I think this might be a good tool to help us
keep track of what each of us is working on, and to help us see how we
each fit into the master plan.  (If there is a master plan. :-)

So, if you don't mind, I'd love to get a quick couple of sentence
blurb on what you are doing and how it is going so I can put it up on
the web page.

Thanks!

Curt.

Right now, I'd call what I'm doing "Trying to get a self-consistant
platform independant framework for graphics, driver loading, and
initialization."  I'm not sure how else I could state it.

A thing that I would like to see added to the "to do/call for volunteers"
list is:

We need to get FG_BITMAPS to the screen, under every architecture and
display type.  Some are easy, some are hard.  I think the basic prototype
for the function that returns a screen bitmap should be...

void fg_open_display_bitmaps(FG_BITMAP *bitmaps[],int *num_windows);

The function would set up an array of bitmaps for the display windows.
The number of display windows would vary with display type, setup.  The
minimum number of windows is, of course, one.  (To look a the definition
of a bitmap, see fgtypes.h at my web site.)  The main idea is that anything
written to one of these bitmaps would end up on the screen.  (P.S. the
display windows also have to be opened by this call.)

I'm planning on writing the above function for OS/2 using DIVE (direct
interface to video extensions).  My plan is to set up a process in the
background running at low priority to blit these bitmaps to the display,
with an option of putting the bitmaps directly in video memory.

I'll also do a sunos version that writes directly to the frame buffer 
(/dev/fb) using the memmap() API.  (This may also work on linux?)

I'd like someone to write an X11 version, using MIT shared memory is
probably the way to go.  Any X11 gurus out there?

DOS is going to be a tough one.  Because of the wacky way the video
memory is set up in DOS there will probably be multiple drivers, one
for bank switching, one for a VESA linear buffer.  My suggestion is
to setup a function linked to the timer interrupt that updates the
screen.  The tough part about this is locking the interrupt routines
into physical memory.  Any suggestions Mauritzio?

I've also noticed that we're missing two major platforms in our team
so far, Macintosh and Windows.  I know nothing about Mac programming,
so there's lots of work to be done there.  I'm also no Windows guru, but
I'd guess that most of the OS/2 stuff I've done so far will work under
Win 32 with little modification.  (Change DosLoadModule to LoadModule :))

I may send a message to comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.graphics and
comp.sys.mac.programmer.games about our little project.

Eric

Well, you have me down as working on the ATC module, and while that's 
probably true -- I'm going to actually have to learn C before I write 
something! <big wink> Right now, this is basically my most 
complicated program:

#include <stdio.h>
#define endif
main(int argc, char *argv)
{
    char program_usage[]=
    "Hi, this program doesn't do anything!";

    if (argc < 2 || argc > 4)
      puts(program_usage);
    else argc == 3;
      printf("This program still doesn't do anything!");
    endif;
}

Oooh, that's great! :)

I have a Mac, and I'm just getting to learn C in my spare time, which I never
have.  I know a little Mac programming at the time, but if you need a
technical ?'s answered, I know the Mac OS in and out since I fix Macs
everyday!
