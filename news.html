      <LI> Continued development of voice ATC, robot aircraft AI, logical
  taxiway networks (continues to be a work in progess, but much
  progress has been made.)

  and moved it over to SimGear where it can be potentially used by
  other projects.
      <LI> Separated out the low level sound effect playing/management code and
  moved it over to SimGear.

      automatically vary the wind within these ranges.
      <LI> A "physical" crash (i.e. too-hard impact with the ground) causes the
      sim to freeze.  You can then reset the sim to the starting state
      with the menu->reset option.
      <P>

      <LI> Support in the scenery tile cache for maintaining tiles in the cache
      relative to several view points that could be

      <LI> Added an entirely new set of flight dynamics modeling code by Andy Ross.
  Includes several aircraft such as a 747, A4, and DC-3.
  This is (Y)et (A)nother Flight Dynamics (Sim)ulator.  It is a first cut
  of a "different take" on FDM design.  It's intended to be very simple
  to use, producing reasonable results for aircraft of all sorts and sizes,
  while maintaining simulation plausibility even in odd flight conditions
  like spins and aerobatics.  It's at the point now where one can
  actually fly the planes around.
      <LI> Added an optional embedded http server that provides a property
  manager interface to external programs and scripts.

	   and if you can use them.
      <LI> Added a visibility= command line option for setting intial
           visibility distance.
      <LI> Range of tiles loaded and drawn are now directly calculated
           from the current visibility distance so that the ground

      <LI> Tony Peden contributed a c172 flight model replacement for
           the Navion.  Still needs to be debugged a bit before it is
           usable.
      <LI> More MacOS portability fixes.
      <LI> More Borland C++ fixes.
      <LI> More IRIX fixes.
      <LI> Fixed a bug in handling windows drive letter, colon "C:"

      <LI> Minor tweaks to the Astro sub section contributed by Durk
           Talsma. 
      <LI> GUI updated contributed by Norman Vine.
      <LI> Fixed a problem with ambiguous constructors in the fgText
           class. 
      <LI> Updates to JSBsim contributed by Jon Berndt.
      <LI> Created a tile load queue so that we only load one tile per
           frame.  This isn't entirely satisfactory, but it reduces
	   the length of the pause when crossing a tile boundary with
	   several shorter pauses.
      <LI> Fixed bug with passing PUI keystrokes on to glut.
      <LI> Fixed a bug in tilecache size which caused occasional tiles
           to drop out when more than one row is scheduled
	   "simultaneously".
      <LI> Changes to scenery building tools to handle sliver
           detection and resolution.
      <LI> Fixed several other minor bugs in the scenery creation
           tools. 
      <LI> Added urban area support to scenery creation tools.
      <LI> Made the parallel scenery building tools a bit more robust
           if a requested client machine happens to be offline by
	   pinging it first to see if it is alive.

    <UL>
      <LI> Tons of improvements with scenery creation.  Inter-tile
           gaps have been fixed, distorted textures have been fixed,
	   real coastlines have been added, and many other subtle
	   improvements. 
      <LI> Tools for parallelizing the scenery building tasks.  For
           instance by using 20 machines in parallel, scenery for the
	   entire USA can be regenerated in just over 4 hours vs. 70+
	   hours on a single machine.  
      <LI> Texture scale can be specified (and changed)( in the
           materials file.  The sim must be rerun for the change to
	   take effect.
      <LI> Windows now uses plib joystick code so rudder pedals should
           now work. 
      <LI> Now builds against Steve Baker's plib (portable game devel
           library) distributed separately
	   (www.woodsoup.org/~sbaker/plib/) 
      <LI> Many source code changes for the MacOS port contributed by

      <LI> Source code changes for better compiling with the Borland
           compiler.

	   = +/-180. 
      <LI> Tweaks to the Astro section contributed by Durk Talsma.
      <LI> Autopilot improvements contributed by Norman Vine.
      <LI> Fonts/characters now drawn with texture maps for increased speed.
      <LI> Instrument panel can be toggled on and off with "P".
      <LI> GUI interface for tweaking some autopilot parameters.
      <LI> HUD appearance and layout changes contributed by Norman
           Vine, includes faster font drawing for much better performance.
      <LI> Reset function added to reset you to your starting conditions.
      <LI> GUI function to enter a new airport id (and be transported there)

      <LI> Removed gpc from the Lib section of distribution by request of the
           gpc Author.  The gpc license is unfortunately not compatible with
           the GPL.  I may look for an alternative library, or just require
           that developers download this library separately.
      <LI> First slew of changes from the MacOS porting effort
           contributed by "Robert Puyol" <PUYOL@ABVENT.FR>.
      <LI> Support for an arbitrary number of serial ports +

           more like a GPS.
      <LI> Portability enhancements for Borland, Solaris, and SGI.
      <LI> Some internal class renaming and reorganizations.  fgFLIGHT
           becomes FGState.  fgCONTROLS becomes FGControls.
      <LI> Started work on an "external" flight model so the sim can
           be driven from external input (serial port, network, file,
           etc.)
      <LI> Fixed a problem that creeped in with setting the initial
           startup altitude.  This could cause an unrecoverable bounce
           and you'd end up flipped on your back.  Should be fixed
           now.
      <LI> Sun now appears to grow in size as it gets very low in the
           horizon.
      <LI> Fixed a view frustum culling bug where the scene was not
           accurately culled when your view was anything other than
           straight forward.

           You can still use meters by specifying the command line
           option "--units-meters".
      <LI> Added some initial joystick support using Steve's joystick
           interface class.  This works great under Linux, but Steve's
	   class now needs to be ported to Windoze and other platforms.
      <LI> Also added a fall back to the GLUT joystick routines for
           windows (until we can find better joystick support.)
      <LI> Added some initial serial port support for acting like gps
           and outputing nmea data such that could be fed into a

      <LI> Miscellaneous code clean ups, portability improvements, and
           optimizations.

    <UL>
      <LI> Some initial "GameGLUT" support contributed by Gary R. Van
           Sickle (tiberius@braemarinc.com)
      <LI> Tracked down and eliminated some memory access type bugs
           that were causing segfaults on some platforms, with some
	   compilers using various optimization flags.
      <LI> Assorted code optimizations submitted by Norman Vine.
      <LI> Renamed fg to fgfs
      <LI> Shuffled files.  
        <UL>
          <LI> Created a new directory Simulator/Airports/ to handle
               airport data specific tasks 
          <LI> Created Simulator/Object/ to handle basic rendering
               objects 
        </UL>
      <LI> Panel code update from Friedemann Reinhard (use
           --enable-panel to activate) 
      <LI> Contributions from Bernie Bright
        <UL>
          <LI> Created some new classes to enable
               pointers-to-functions and pointers-to-class-methods to
	       be treated like objects.  These objects can be
	       registered with fgEVENT_MGR.
          <LI> File "Include/fg_callback.hxx" contains the callback
               class defns.
          <LI> Modified fgEVENT and fgEVENT_MGR to use the callback
               classes.  Also some minor tweaks to STL usage.
          <LI> Added file "Include/fg_stl_config.h" to deal with STL
               portability issues.  Added an initial config for egcs
	       (and probably gcc-2.8.x). Don't have access to Visual
	       C++ so I've left that for someone else. 
          <LI> This file is influenced by the stl_config.h file
               delivered with egcs. 
          <LI> Added "Include/auto_ptr.hxx" which contains an
               implementation of the STL auto_ptr class which is not
	       provided in all STL implementations and is needed to
	       use the callback classes.
          <LI> Deleted fgLightUpdate() which was just a wrapper to
               call fgLIGHT::Update(). 
          <LI> Modified fg_init.cxx to register two method callbacks
               in place of the old wrapper functions.
          <LI> The new classes in libmisc.tgz define a stream
               interface into zlib.  I've put these in a new
	       directory, Lib/Misc.  Feel free to rename it to
	       something more appropriate.  However you'll have to
	       change the include directives in all the other files.
	       Additionally you'll have add the library to
	       Lib/Makefile.am and Simulator/Main/Makefile.am.

          <LI> The StopWatch class in Lib/Misc requires a
               HAVE_GETRUSAGE autoconf test so I've included the
	       required changes in config.tgz.
                                                                              
          <LI> There are a fair few changes to Simulator/Objects as
               I've moved things around.  Loading tiles is quicker but
	       thats not where the delay is.  Tile loading takes a few
	       tenths of a second per file on a P200 but it seems to
	       be the post-processing that leads to a noticeable blip
	       in framerate.  I suppose its time to start profiling to
	       see where the delays are.

      <LI> added an enable/disable intro music option.
      <LI> added an enable/disable instrument panel option.
      <LI> added an enable/disable mouse pointer option.
      <LI> Ground collision detection.  You can now land or test for
           collision with any scenery surface.

      <LI> Managment of multiple textures
      <LI> Incorporated Friedemann Reinhard's initial panel code.
      <LI> Fog mode is now GL_FOG_EXP2 instead of GL_FOG_LINEAR
      <LI> Build the non-shared pieces of the FG sim as static libs.

  <LI> <STRONG>June 9, 1998: Version 0.48 released.</STRONG>
    <UL>
      <LI> Incorporated Steve Baker's PUI user interface library
           written entirely on top of OpenGL.
      <LI> Incorporated Steve Baker's Audio library which currently
           only supports Linux, but a win32 port is very close to
           being done.
      <LI> Sort object fragments by material property before
           rendering.  This will be a big help to performance when we
           start including objects with a wide variety of material
           properties and textures.
      <LI> Overlapped scenery tiles to reduce the chance of an
           occasional floating point precission induced gaps.
      <LI> Fixed a bug in zlib exposed by Borland Win32 compiler.
      <LI> Impose a maximum triangle area during scenery generation so
           even very flat areas will get split into a few smaller sub
           triangles.
      <LI> Fine grained (fragment level) view frustum culling.
      <LI> view transformation optimizations -- Norman Vine.
      <LI> Fixed polygon winding problem in scenery generation, so all
           tri-strips are wound counter clockwise (opengl default).
    </UL>
  <P>

  <LI> <STRONG>May 18, 1998: Version 0.47 released.</STRONG>
    <UL>
      <LI> Added course (per tile) view frustum culling.
      <LI> Added a command line option to specify --fg-root which will
           override $FG_ROOT
      <LI> Hard coded default locations for FG_ROOT for situations
           when nothing is specified.  Unix =
           /usr/local/lib/FlightGear Win32 = \FlightGear
      <LI> Restructured the command line processing code so that it
           can process these sames comands (one per line) out of a
           config file.
      <LI> Added a command line option to specify field of view.  This
           is adjustable at run time using "X" and "x".  Supporting
           code contributed by Norman Vine.
    </UL>
    <P>

  <LI> <STRONG>May 11, 1998: Version 0.46 released.</STRONG>
    <UL>
      <LI> Complete C++ re-write of the HUD section.
      <LI> Miscellaneous bug fixes and tweaks.
    </UL>
    <P>

  <LI> <STRONG>May 7, 1998: Version 0.45 released.</STRONG>
    <UL>
      <LI> Added an option to enable/disable wireframe rendering.
      <LI> Added an option to enable/disable fog/haze.
      <LI> Added an option to enable/disable sky blending.
      <LI> Added an option to select smooth/flat polygon shading.
      <LI> Added an option to enable full-screen mode.
      <LI> Added a visual frame rate counter on the HUD.  (Contributed
           by Durk Talsma) 
      <LI> Autopilot updates (Jeff Goeke-Smith)
      <LI> Added an option to control the number of neighboring tiles
           that are drawn 
    </UL>
    <P>

 <LI> <STRONG>Apr 28, 1998: Version 0.44 released.</STRONG>
    <UL>
       <LI> Fixed a horrible bug that cause the time to be *WAY* off when
       compiling with the CygWin32 compiler. <BR>
       <LI> Wrapped up zlib so we can conditionally compile back in
       normal behavior on systems that have trouble building zlib. <BR>
       <LI> Minor adjustment to texture coordinate generation to reduce
       texture swimming. <BR>
       <LI> Added an option to enable/disable texture maps. <BR>
       <LI> Minor transformation adjustments to try to keep scenery tiles
       closer to (0, 0, 0).  GLfloats run out of precision at the
       distances we need to model the earth, but we can do a bunch of
       pre-transformations using double floats and then cast to
       GLfloat once everything is close in where we have less
       precision problems. <BR>
       <LI> Add a command line option to set starting position by airport
       ID. <BR>
       <LI> Cleaned up initialization sequence to eliminate
       interdependencies between sun position, lighting, and view
       position.  This creates a valid single pass initialization
       path. <BR>
       <LI> Use already calculated LaRCsim values to create the
       roll/pitch/yaw transformation matrix.
    </UL>
    <P>

  <LI> <STRONG>Apr 23, 1998: Version 0.43 released.</STRONG>  Material
       properties bug fixed when rendering terrain.  Bug in sky color
       generation fixed.  Bug in fog color generation fixed.
       Incorporated zlib on the fly decompression/compression support.
       More code reorganization and clean ups.  Fixed up the 30 arcsec
       DEM file preprocessor.  (World wide DEM's are available in this
       format.)
  <LI> <STRONG>Apr 14, 1998: Version 0.42 released.</STRONG>  This includes
       a simple heading hold autopilot and code reorganizations and clean 
       ups.
  <LI> <STRONG>Apr 8, 1998: Version 0.41 released.</STRONG>  This includes
       initial texture support and the Gnu automake/autoconf system.  A bug
       in the terrain processing tools has been fixed so that the results
       are no longer "bunk."
