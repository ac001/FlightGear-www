The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has formed an Aircraft Icing 
Research Center in the College of Engineering. The purpose of this group is 
to identify and undertake the basic and applied research necessary to 
improve the safety of flight in atmospheric icing conditions. An 
interdisciplinary team of 10 faculty from 3 departments and a variety of 
disciplines have developed the concept for the UIUC Aircraft Icing Research 
Center over the last three years.  Initial funding was been provided by the 
University Critical Research Initiatives Program and began on July 1, 1997.

Smart Icing Systems Project: The objective of this research is to improve 
the safety of aircraft operating in atmospheric (including ground) icing 
conditions. The approach is to improve the ice tolerance of aircraft by 
developing autonomous systems which will sense changes in aircraft 
performance and handling qualities and respond in a human centered fashion 
to enable the aircraft to maintain control and flight safety. We are 
conducting the fundamental research necessary to develop such a smart icing 
systems concept. The funding for this research is being provided by the 
NASA Glenn Research Center.
<P>

The FlightGear Flight Simulator (FGFS) is one of three flight
simulators being used in the development of the smart icing system.
The other two simulators are being used to aid in the development of
core technologies to be ultimately included in FGFS for use in
realtime pilot-in-the-loop simulations to study systems integration
and human factors issues.  To make use of the FGFS, a reconfigurable
aircraft model that includes aircraft icing effects was incorporated
into the code.  The team is currently modeling the NASA Glenn Twin
Otter, but overall 15 new aircraft models are available.  Only the
Twin Otter model includes parameters that model the degradation of
flight that can occur in icing conditions.
