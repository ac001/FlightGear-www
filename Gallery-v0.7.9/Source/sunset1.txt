A nice sunset - This images demonstrates the pinkish orange glow in the
sky that builds as the sun gets lower in the sky.  If you could only pan
around (and you can if you are running the binary) you would see that
the pink fades and the sky gets darker as you look towards the other side
of the sky.  OpenGL is really, really cool. :-)
