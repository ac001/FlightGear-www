<H1>FGFS Places to Fly</H1><BR><BR>

FGFS has some of the most accurate and realistic terrain of any PC
simulator.  Here are some places you can go to check out some of this
cool terrain.
<P>

You should be able to start at these sites by using the
"--airport-id=ABCD" and "--heading=nnn" options.
<P>

For windoze people this might look something like the following.  Note
that the double quotes are important to preserve the equal sign when
passing arguments through a batch file:

<PRE>
    runfgfs "--airport-id=64U" "--heading=198"
</PRE>

Unix users don't need the double quotes, although they shouldn't hurt
anything.

<PRE>
    fgfs --airport-id=64U --heading=198
</PRE>

<P>

If you know if any other interesting places or routes to fly, please
let me know and I can add them to this list.

<P>

<TD><A HREF="http://www.airnav.com/airport/25U">25U</A>
<TD>Hell's Canyon, Imnaha, OR.  This airport is located just west of
"Hell's Canyon National Park" which has the Snake River running
through it.  Supposedly it's a 5500 foot drop from the top of the
canyon to the river.  The airport is located on the brink of this
canyon.
<P>
See the remarks on the airport page (click on the airport id)
... DOWNDRAFTS, SHEER DROP IN TERRAIN, LIVESTOCK, etc.  Don't go here
on your first solo x-country. :-)

<TD><STRONG>Crater Lake National Park Tour</STRONG><BR>

<TD><A HREF="http://www.airnav.com/airport/64S">64S</A>
<TD>Prospect, OR.
<P>

Take off and fly at a heading of about 40 degrees until you cross the
first distinct ridge in front of you. (several minutes of flight in
the navion ... just climb as fast as you can, it will be a close
squeek to get over :-)
<P>

Once you clear the ridge and can see beyond it, turn right and fly a
heading of about 70 degrees.  You should see two shallow peaks off in
the distance.  Head right between these -- they are the two sides of
the crater.  As you get closer the shape of the crater will come into
view.  There's a lake there in real life, hopefully it will be there
in flight gear too before long.

<TD><STRONG>Grand Canyon Tour</STRONG><BR>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sunsite.org.uk/sites/ftp.flightgear.org/flightgear-ftp/Scenery/w120n30.tar.gz">w120n30.tar.gz</A>

<A HREF="http://www.airnav.com/airport/AZ38">AZ38</A>, 
<TD>These airports are in the vicinity of the Grand Canyon.  From
KGCN head north.  From 1Z1 head south.  From 1G4 head north (I think.)
From AZ38 head north.

<TD><STRONG>Ranger Creek Airport</STRONG><BR>

<TD><A HREF="http://www.airnav.com/airport/6WA8">6WA8</A>
<TD>Greenwater, WA.  This airport is wedged into the bottom of a steep canyon.
You definitely need to be on your toes to get in and out of here.  I'd hate
to think about what the wind would do to you in real life. 
<TR>
<P>

<TD><STRONG>Mount Rainier Tour</STRONG><BR>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sunsite.org.uk/sites/ftp.flightgear.org/flightgear-ftp/Scenery/w130n40.tar.gz">w130n40.tar.gz</A>
<TD><A HREF="http://www.airnav.com/airport/WA20">WA20</A>
<TD>Eatonville, WA.  Start out at Swanson Airport in Eatonville, WA.  Take
off and fly a heading of about 90 degrees.  You will need to fly for 5-10
minutes before the mountain comes into view.  Be patient if you don't see
it right away, it will dwarf everything in it's vicinity.
<TR>
<P>

<TD><STRONG>Death Valley Tour</STRONG><BR>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sunsite.org.uk/sites/ftp.flightgear.org/flightgear-ftp/Scenery/w120n30.tar.gz">w120n30.tar.gz</A>
<TD><A HREF="http://www.airnav.com/airport/L06">L06</A>
<TD>Furnace Creek, CA.  This starts you right in the middle of Death Valley
which runs north & south.  If you head south about 15 miles you'll hit the
lowest point in the USA, 282 feet (86 meters) below sea level.
<TR>
<P>

<TD><STRONG>Utah</STRONG><BR>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sunsite.org.uk/sites/ftp.flightgear.org/flightgear-ftp/Scenery/w120n30.tar.gz">w120n30.tar.gz</A>
<TD><A HREF="http://www.airnav.com/airport/1L7">1L7</A>
<TD>Escalante Muni Airport, Escalante, UT.  This airport is east and a
bit north of Bryce Canyon National park.  If you head mostly south and
a bit east you'll eventually hit the Grand Canyon.  It is sandwiched
between the Dixie National forest to the north and the Grand
Staircase-Escalante National Monument to the south.  There should be
interesting stuff to see no matter which direction you head.
<TR>

<TD><STRONG>Lake County Airport (CO)</STRONG><BR>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sunsite.org.uk/sites/ftp.flightgear.org/flightgear-ftp/Scenery/w110n30.tar.gz">w110n30.tar.gz</A>
<TD><A HREF="http://www.airnav.com/airport/LXV">KLXV</A>
<TD>Lake County Airport, Leadville, CO.  This airport is at an
elevation of 9927 making it a bit of a challenge to get into and out
of with a standard C172.  Make sure you lean out your engine before
taking off and read up on density altitude before you try this one in
real life.
<TR>
<P>

<TD><STRONG>Friedman Memorial Airport (Idaho)</STRONG><BR>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sunsite.org.uk/sites/ftp.flightgear.org/flightgear-ftp/Scenery/w120n40.tar.gz">w120n40.tar.gz</A>
<TD><A HREF="http://www.airnav.com/airport/SUN">KSUN</A>
<TD>Friedman Memorial Airport, Hailey, Idaho.  This airport is nestled
in a valley surrounded by significant terrain.  It's one that shows up
quite often in accident investigations.
<TR>
