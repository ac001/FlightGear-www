Final approach to taxiway "Y".  Taxiway "Y" is the dark pavement straight
ahead.  The runway construction to the left is light.  Taxiway "N" to the
right is also light.  Runway 30L even further to the left is dark.  Runway 29
way to the left is easy to miss.  You can almost see why taxiway "Y" can
sucker in the less attentive pilots.
