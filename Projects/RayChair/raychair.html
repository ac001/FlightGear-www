<H3>Overview</H3>

The attached photo illustrates a successful integration of Cobra
Technologies Servovalve and Electronic Controller" into a precission
three axis Motion Base Simulator. Motion control is initiated by means
of an operator-controlled flight yoke or joystick, used to control
sixty (60) degrees (+/- 30) of pitch and roll axis motion. Rudder
pedals provide (+ /- 15) degrees of motion control for the yaw
axis. The servovalve control system is an efficient, high performance
controller, which features high fluid flow rates and broad bandwidth
capability (nearly 200 HZ). Two 1/8 H.P. pneumatic airbrush
compressors are used to power the chair. Operating pressures range
from 30-40 PSI.
<P>

Also shown, is a Pentium III 500 Mhz PC, which connects with the
joystick and rudder pedals allowing for the playing of numerous PC
games and flight simulator packages, such as Microsoft's popular
"Flight Simulator 2000".  Images are displayed on a 18 inch LCD
monitor.  Added sound, via a 50-watt base speaker attached underneath
the chair base, provides additional realism.  Mechanical sound
resonance sensed by the operator further enhances the "Gaming
Experience".
<P>

A recent software upgrade to the chairs flight simulation capability
includes the ability to fly "FlightGear" Open-Source software
(www.flightgear.org) a realistic Linux based "closed Loop" flight
simulation packaged featuring a USB interface. Software "hooks"
implemented into the FlightGear software, provide real-time pitch,
roll, and yaw aircraft flight angles. These digital signals are output
and converted, through use of a 12-bit D/A converter, to drive the
servovalve/actuator assembly. This action insures accurate responsive
simulator chair and aircraft motion synchronization, culminating in a
realistic motion control event.

<H3>The Heart of the System</H3>

The servovalve used in the above application was developed from a
grant from the National Science Foundation. In addition to the
mechanical features found in the valve, a unique computer (algorithm)
control system was developed which insures fast stable dynamic
response.
<P>

Our current valve design, for Flight Simulator / Game Chair
applications is calculated to flow 30 scfm, at 100 PSI, although the
valve design is capable of operating at much higher pressures and flow
rates.

<H3>Up Coming Event</H3>

The Flight Simulator Motion Chair will be featured July 7-9 2000, at
the San Diego Convention Center, in San Diego, Ca., in an
ExpoProductions, Inc. Presentation called " Toys" For Big Boys And
Girls Expo.  On July 7, a special showing will be held comprised of
community & business leaders, Sports Figures..etc., including a "So
Kids Can Dream" Charity Silent Auction.
<P>

The Expo will also provide local television news coverage of the
Flight Simulation Chair. As a special treat the show promoters will
invite Apollo Astronauts Wally Schirra and or Buz Aldrin to take the
controls.
