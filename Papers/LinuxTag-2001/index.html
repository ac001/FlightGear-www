Project focus<BR>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>To create high quality simulation that
		<UL>
		<LI>minimises short cuts and runs on ordinary computers
		<LI>extensible and encourages local modifications
		</UL>
	</UL>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>Started April 1996 by David Murr
		<UL>
		<LI>Open source (GPL) - No commercial backing as yet
		<LI>Curt Olson made a multiplatform release in July 1997
		</UL>
	<LI>Since then, it expanded beyond flight aerodynamics 
		<UL>
		<LI>improving graphics, clouds and fog,
		<LI>a shaded sky with sun, moon and stars correctly drawn,
		<LI>automated worldwide scenery, network play,
		<LI>electronic navigation systems, airports and runways,
		<LI>head up display and instrument panel and much more ...
		</UL>
	</UL>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>Scales up from commodity computers
		<UL>
		<LI>For commercial and research applications
		<LI>Fairly easy using Linux on various targets

Shrinkwrap sale<BR>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>Reselling open source software ?
		<UL>
		<LI>It has not been a good revenue source for other companies
		<LI>Partly because of the rapid version changes
		<LI>And because of the low cost of bandwidth for the consumer
		</UL>
	<LI>Yet, several organizations are considering it
		<UL>
		<LI>Can FlightGear be a viable profit center?
		</UL>
	</UL>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>It is being repackaged by many distributions
		<UL>
		<LI>To ensure a painless installation for the community
		<LI>There appears to be little benefit in making a product here
		<LI>Closed source flight sim games are available at under $20
		</UL>
	</UL>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>Separate the database of visual scenery

Shrinkwrap sale - Scenery<BR>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>The scenery needs lots of space
		<UL>
		<LI>About a gigabyte for each continent currently
		<LI>Is unlikely to get any smaller in future
		<LI>This still represents a significant download
		</UL>
	<LI>The scenery is relatively stable over time

		<LI>Old versions are usually useful with newer binary software
		<LI>Upgrades only add detail to an existing and viable database
		</UL>

<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>There is clearly a retail opportunity
		<UL>
		<LI>Probably a DVD or a dozen CDs of the world

Streaming scenery - concept<BR>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>Consider general aviation aircraft
		<UL>
		<LI>Cruise usually below 200 knots, often only 120 knots
		<LI>Flight visibility is (in real life) usually below 20 miles
		<LI>For lower altitudes used by non-turbocharged piston engines
		</UL>
	<LI>Maximum of 8000 square miles per hour
		<UL>
		<LI>Even when flying in a straight line (worst case)
		<LI>This is new terrain that will come into view
		<LI>Currently, database uses 1 MB/ 600 sq miles
		</UL>
	<LI>Streaming rate 12 megabytes/hour will be sufficient
		<UL>
		<LI>That will fit through a normal 56K modem link
		<LI>An airliner at cruising altitude needs all your DSL
		</UL>
	</UL>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>Bandwidth is often much lower
		<UL>
		<LI>Because some scenery may already be downloaded
		<LI>Will be zero in your favorite flight areas

Streaming scenery - implementation<BR>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>No change to FlightGear source is needed
		<UL>
		<LI>The latitude and longitude of the aircraft are exported
		<LI>Scenery is stored in convenient 100 sqkm pieces
		<LI>An independent program can make directed requests
		<LI>For example, by spawning "wget" calls
		</UL>
	<LI>Still any need for retail scenery packages ?
	</UL>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>Multiply this bandwidth by worldwide community
		<UL>
		<LI>That is a sizeable traffic impact on the servers
		<LI>Latency is critical; we must keep ahead of the pilot
		<LI>Is the total still low enough to be supported for goodwill ?
		<LI>Will free servers transition to monthly access fees ?

Flight Training<BR>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>Could also be helpful when learning to fly

	<LI>What does the U.S. government want ?
		<UL>
		<LI>Any pilot can sit down and immediately use it
		<LI>It isn't dangerously different or deceptively easy
		<LI>The instructor can specify the flight environment

Flight training - OverRegulated ?<BR>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>The FAA is responding to human nature
		<UL>
		<LI>That doesn't go away just because it's inconvenient
		</UL>
	<LI>The things learnt first
		<UL>
		<LI>Leave an almost unshakeable impression
		<LI>At times of severe stress, will over-rule later training
		<LI>Any false impressions are learned by a beginning student
		<LI>Tend to remain hidden until a potentially lethal situation
		<LI>At that time the pilot may react wrongly
		</UL>
	<LI>An excessively optimistic opinion
		<UL>
		<LI>Of piloting skills will result if simulator is easy
		<LI>Or if it does not exhibit common instrument flaws
		<LI>A pilot will willingly fly into dangerous situations
		<LI>that are beyond their skill proficiency and be at risk
		</UL>
	<LI>Only a trained instructor can judge
		<UL>
		<LI>Whether the learning experience is beneficial
		<LI>The documentation materials are essential to that

What's in the future?<BR>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>FDMs are not (yet) accurate enough
		<UL>
		<LI>Only suitable for conservative flights
		<LI>Don't reflect the challenges of acrobatic maneuvering
		</UL>
	</UL>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>Higher performance human input devices
		<UL>
		<LI>Beyond the 8-bit joystick resolution limit
		<LI>Rugged and rigid, like real aircraft controls
		</UL>
	</UL>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>New consumer technologies for immersion
		<UL>
		<LI>Surround projectors, head mounted displays
		<LI>Directional sound and cockpit motion effects
		<LI>Users will fly safe, forgetting they're not in danger
		</UL>
	</UL>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>Recent radar and visual satellite surveys
		<UL>
		<LI>Enough detail to be used as photorealistic scenery
		<LI>First, we must manipulate terabytes in real time
		<LI>Data volume is about a million times larger than now

Conclusions<BR>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>FlightGear is a simple Open Source project
		<UL>
		<LI>Builds on many existing projects
		<LI>In the community tradition
		</UL>
	</UL>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>Due to the subject it addresses
		<UL>
		<LI>It has many issues and concerns
		<LI>Are raised that rarely inconvenience other projects
		</UL>
	</UL>
<BR>
	<UL>
	<LI>These elements are providing the exciting challenges
		<UL>
		<LI>And variety of associated activities
		<LI>Enjoyed by the developers
