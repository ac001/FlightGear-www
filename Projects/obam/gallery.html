<H1>OV-10 Bronco Association Museum Simulator Project</H1>

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>

The <A href="http://www.ov-10bronco.net/OBA/">OV-10 Bronco Association</A>
 is a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving the history of the OV-10 
 Bronco and the Forward Air Controller (FAC) mission.  The association is based 
 at Meacham Field in Fort Worth, Texas, and has established a museum there.  The
 museum's collection is growing rapidly and includes two recently purchased Broncos.  
 In 2005 Dave Culp, a former USAF Bronco pilot, put together a PC-based flight 
 simulation station for the museum, based on FlightGear.<p>


<H3>FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION</H3>

The OV-10 simulator hardware consists of a standard PC with an AMD 2300+ CPU, 
512 MB RAM, GeForce MX4000 video card, standard peripherals with speakers and
a USB joystick.  The monitor was supplied by the museum, which helped keep the 
shipping costs down.<p>

The operating system is linux, Mandrake 10.1, with the latest nVidia video driver,
the KDE desktop, and can be used as a workstation if need be.<p>

The simulator software is a slightly modified version of FlightGear 0.9.8, optimized 
for use by the general public by simplifying some controls and adding automatic 
crash detection and reset.  The simulation starts with the user OV-10 on the runway 
at Ramstein Airbase, Germany, with engines running.  The user experience is enhanced 
with the addition of over forty Artificial Intelligence (AI) aircraft which fly in 
the vicinity of Ramstein.  The types of AI aircraft used in the simulation were 
chosen to reflect the usual air traffic in southwest Germany circa 1980.<p>

<H3>Future Plans</H3>

The obvious next step will be to build a replica OV-10 cockpit with 
functioning stick, rudder pedals, and power and condition levers, and
to install a big-screen display!<p>
