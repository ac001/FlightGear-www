          for internet access, buying a CD is a convenient and possibly
          cheaper option.  Although we offer that service (see the website), we
          encourage other groups to redistribute it for their users, especially
          within an operating system distribution which makes installation even

          <P>Well, that depends.  First make sure you are using the appropriate
          versions of FlightGear, SimGear, plib, zlib, and metakit.  If any of
          the packages are out of sync with the others, compilation may fail.</P>

          (<A HREF="http://flightgear.org/Downloads/">http://flightgear.org/Downloads/</A>)
          should tell you what versions you need if you are trying to compile
          the latest stable release.  If you are using a development snapshot,
          make sure all three packages are up-to-date.</P>
          <P>Also ensure that you have some implementation of OpenGL with glut
          support with the appropriate header files.  Linux users with nVidia
          cards should make sure you have the latest drivers from nVidia.  Other
          Linux users make sure you have Mesa3D

          <P>FlightGear (as of June 2001) uses the Portable Libraries (PLIB)
          for playing audio. The audio queue implementation of PLIB is far from
          optimal (in fact it's just wrong).  This seems to work on other
          platforms quite well, but Irix expects things to be programmed

          the OpenAL audio implementation does the job right, meaning that
          these audio problems should be gone by then. In the mean time it is
          best to disable audio on Irix completely (by adding --disable-sound

          <P>
        <B>Linux users</B>:  If you are an nVidia user, follow their

          appropriate kernel device drivers for your card.  Most people (and

        <DIV CLASS="indent">
          <P>First of all, one of the most common mistakes on SGI hardware is to
          forget to specify --fog-fastest. On most SGI machines the EXP2 shading
          model isn't hardware supported resulting in frame rates below 1 frame
          per second (fps).</P>
          <P>FlightGear makes extensive use of the OpenGL z-buffer feature,which
          on most older SGI hardware is only supported in software. This means
          that the CPU has to do all the z-buffer calculations in addition to the
          other tasks FlightGear involves (flight dynamics, scenery tracking,
          pushing commands into the graphics queue, etc).  The following features
          are software rendered on low-end SGI machines (like Indy and
          Indigo):</P>

            <LI>texturing</LI>
          </UL>
          <P>This means that running FlightGear with the following options may not
          even get the desired result:</P>

        <CODE>./runfgfs --fog-disable --shading-flat --disable-skyblend \</CODE>

          <P>For the stubborn people out there:  The trick to learn is to roll
          back to normal (non inverted) do this by nursing the elevator to get
          to about 500 feet or so and use the ailerons to snap roll 180*.
          This is all good avionics except for the plane not destroying

          longitude and latitude where you plan to place the object.</P>
          <P>Now get the altitude for your point.  If you don't want to
          calculate this yourself, start FlightGear at your location and take
          note of the altitude.  Here's an example command:</P>
          <P>
        <CODE>fgfs --lat=45.50 --lon=-75.73 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee fgfs.log</CODE>
      </P>
          <P>The altitude is probably in feet, so divide the starting altitude
          by 3.28.</P>
          <P>Search the output log file for the first occurrence of the string
          "Loading tile" and take note of the filename.  In the above example,
          the output line looks like:</P>
          <P>
        <CODE>Loading tile /usr/local/Scenery/w080n40/w076n45/1712601</CODE>
      </P>
          <P>Copy a 3D model in a format that Plib understands to the same
          directory as the tile file.  Edit the text file in that directory
          consisting of the tile name with the extension ".stg".  The file will
          already exist if there is an airport on the tile; otherwise, you can
          create it from scratch.  In our example, the filename is:</P>
          <P>
        <CODE>/usr/local/Scenery/w080n40/w076n45/1712601.stg</CODE>
      </P>
          <P>At the end of the file, add a new entry for your object,
          consisting of the word "OBJECT_STATIC" followed by the model name,
          the longitude in degrees, the latitude in degrees, the altitude in
          meters, and the heading in degrees.  In our example the line looks
          like:</P>
          <P>
        <CODE>OBJECT_STATIC Towerax.ac -75.73 45.40 60 0</CODE>

        <DIV CLASS="indent">
          <P>Contributing to the 2D panel doesn't require any coding at all,
          just a minimal knowledge of XML syntax (i.e. five minutes' worth)
          and good skills with drawing and/or paint programs.  Every instrument
          on the current panel, with the partial exception of the magnetic
          compass, is defined entirely in XML with no custom C++  code.  If
          you want to get started, take a look at John Check's excellent intro
          (<A HREF="http://rockfish.net/fg/README.xmlpanel">http://rockfish.net/fg/README.xmlpanel</A>).
          </P>
          <P>Likewise, if you want to create a 3D cockpit for FlightGear, or to
          create buildings, external aircraft models, etc., your help is
          *desperately* needed.  The only rule is to go easy on the triangles
          -- a model with 50,000 triangles probably won't be usable in
          FlightGear, and one with 5,000 triangles, only marginally.  If you
          can design a nice 3D cockpit interior for a Cessna 172 (for example)
          in a 3D design program such as ac3D or ppe, we have coders who will
          be happy to add the support code in the C++.</P>
          <P>If, on the other hand, you really want to get your hands dirty
          with C++ coding, you'll have to buy a good OpenGL book eventually.
          However, FlightGear uses a high-level library, plib, that hides most 
          of the details of OpenGL.  To get started with 3D C++ coding, you
          can take a look at the plib documentation and learn only as much
          OpenGL as you need, when you need it.</P>

          <P>We have an initial stab at this that is incomplete and only seems

          slack here and develop this further.  Plib now has some low level
          networking support for multi-player games.  It would also be nice to
