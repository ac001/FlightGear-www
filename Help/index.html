<H2>FGFS Help Wanted</H2>

<HR>

There are many ways to get involved with the Flight Gear project.  If
you'd like to get involved, I encourage you to find an area where you
are interested, discuss a bit about what you are doing and how you are
going about it with the other developers and then go to it. <P>

To keep development synchronized, I'd appreciate if you'd let the
developers know in advance what you plan to work on.  This way we can
make sure that you have the latest versions of the relevant code, we
can make sure you understand and benefit from past discussion or
thinking on the subject, and also make sure that no one else's work
will conflict with yours.  Then send in frequent updates relative to
the current cvs version.  It is important to keep close communication
so we all know what everyone else is working on and development stays
in sync. <P>

If you wish to participate with the FlightGear project, step one is to
down load the code and get it to compile on your system.

<H2>Goals</H2>

Here are a few assorted things we'd like to accomplish in the
foreseeable future.

<UL>
  <LI> Oliver Delise began a module to handle "multi-player" flying
       over a network.  He moved on to bigger and better things before
       this was finished.  It would be great to find someone to pick
       this project back up and go with it.

  <LI> FlightGear supports the ability to create a variety of aircraft
       including flight dynamics, custom 3d (external) visual models,
       custom instrument panels, and custom sounds.  We need people to
       begin creating their favorite aircraft.

  <LI> Terrain/scenery paging in a background process.  We now have a
       first stab at this but it still requires some future tweaking.

  <LI> Airports, including runway markings and lighting.  We have
       runway markings implemented fairly well, but we still need to
       do lighting and taxiways.

  <LI> Support for draping roads, railroads, and streams on top of
       our 3d terrain.

  <LI> It would be great to have someone work on a more
       flexible and dynamic 3D clouds implementation.

  <LI> Gas turbine engines.  Right now effort has been concentrated on
       modeling piston engines.  We need someone to put the same
       amount of effort in modeling gas turbine engines so we can
       begin to model the higher performance 'modern' jets.
</UL>
