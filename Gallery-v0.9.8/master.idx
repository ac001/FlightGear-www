I will typically put the most recent images first.  In general, the
closer you get to the bottom, the older the code was when the image
was captured.

<B>January 18, 2005</B> - Coninciding with the official Airbus A380 roll out
and unveiling of the new Airbus livery, here are a few screenshots of the
FlightGear A380.

Syd Adams has built a nice deHavilland Beaver and a nice Citation-II.
Frederic built a very detailed model of Alcatraz.
Here are a few pictures:

Pictures of some of the San Francisco area.  The buildings and bridges
are modeled by Frederic Bouvier.

Here is a 110 second movie of Lee's YF-23 doing some canyon flying south
east of Mt. Ranier in Washington state.  (19Mb)

Here is a 60 second movie of Lee's YF-23 cruising over some SRTM derived
terrain.  (12Mb)

A new terrain approximation algorithm has been implemented which yields
much nicer results than the previous (really stupid) algorithm.  Here are some
samples from near the SFO bay area.  The new algorithm does a much nicer
job at preserving the important underlying terrain structure including
ridges and valleys.

<H3>June 2002</H3>

Quite a bit of work has been done in support of 3d aircraft models and
animation which can be viewed from tower or chase plane views.  Also a
few of our ground cover textures have been recently reworked.  Here
are a few images:

Here are a few new screen shots taken in the March/April 2002 time frame.

<H3>Open Glass Cockpit Project</H3>

FlightGear now has an interface to the <A

<H3>Taxiways</H3>

We have added taxiways to the major world airports.  These are part of the airport and navaid database maintained by Robin Peel.

<H3>Photo-real airport environments</H3>

FlightGear has some initial support for chopping up aerial/satellite
photos and using them for scenery.  Here is an example from KSJC (San
Jose, CA) showing what can be done with a 64Mb video card.

Here are a few screen shots from around the pattern.  Note, these were
used for a presentation on runway incursion issues.  The final
approach to Taxiway 'Y' is bad, bad, bad and will probably result in
the loss of your ticket unless you have a really good excuse.  Still,
take offs and landings do mistakenly happen on this taxiway from time
to time.

We have also created a method to easily place runway signs using an
ascii text file, rather than having to do any 3d modeling.  Here are
some (sparse) examples.

<H3>Multiple Display Synchronization</H3>

FlightGear has native support for synchronizing multiple displays via
a network.

<H3>Land Use / Land Cover</H3>

David Megginson, recently added support for a global land cover/land use
database.  Here are some of the early results showing a variety of scenery
types.
