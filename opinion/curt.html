<H3>Miscellaneous Personal Opinion</H3>

<STRONG>Re: My ACM proposal</STRONG> <P>

ACM has a lot of interesting things to offer, but for a number of
reasons, I am retracting my previous suggestion that we base our work
off of it's source code. <P>

Eric has done some wonderful initial work on many of the basic
building blocks.  I think we should forge ahead on our own.  I also
think it will be to our advantage (at least initially) to incorperate
strategic pieces of code from ACM and other sources to give ourselves
a jump start.  For instance ACM has a pretty decent flight model we
could just slap in with minimal effort.  At a later date, as the work
progresses, these pieces could be replaced with new and improved
modules.

       HUD, and the very sparse instrument panel.
